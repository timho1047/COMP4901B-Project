Let me analyze the gaps and suggest meal times.\n\n**\ud83d\udcc5 Date:** 2025-12-03\n**\ud83c\udf27\ufe0f Weather:** Mostly cloudy with 20% rain chance during the day, but light rain expected at night (45% chance). **Bring an umbrella** for the evening.\n\n## Analysis of Your Schedule:\n\n**Morning:** \n- 9:00-10:30: HKUST Lesson 1\n- 10:30-12:00: Gap (1.5 hours) - but you need to stay at HKUST for your next lesson\n\n**Afternoon:**\n- 12:00-13:30: HKUST Lesson 2\n- 13:30-15:15: Gap (1 hour 45 minutes) - but you have 1 hour 6 minutes travel to Mei Foo\n\n**Evening:**\n- 15:15-16:15: Job Interview at McDonald's (Mei Foo Plaza)\n- 16:15-17:30: Gap (1 hour 15 minutes) - but you have 17 minutes travel to Sham Shui Po\n- 17:30-19:30: Private Tutorial at Lei Cheng Uk Estate\n\n## Meal Suggestions:\n\n### \ud83c\udf74 **LUNCH (13:30-14:30)**\n**Location:** Near HKUST campus\n**Reason:** You have a 1 hour 45 minute gap after your second lesson, but you need to travel to Mei Foo (1 hour 6 minutes). This gives you about 39 minutes for lunch. I recommend grabbing a quick lunch at the HKUST campus cafeteria or nearby Clear Water Bay restaurants before heading to Mei Foo.\n\n### \ud83c\udf74 **DINNER (19:30-21:00)**\n**Location:** Near Lei Cheng Uk Estate, Sham Shui Po\n**Reason:** Your private tutorial ends at 19:30. Sham Shui Po has excellent local food options. You could have dinner at nearby restaurants like:\n- Local cha chaan teng (tea restaurants)\n- Noodle shops\n- Dai pai dong (open-air food stalls)\n\n## \u26a0\ufe0f Important Travel Notes:\n\n1. **Home \u2192 HKUST:** 1 hour 10 minutes - Leave by **7:50 AM** to arrive by 9:00 AM\n2. **HKUST \u2192 Mei Foo:** 1 hour 6 minutes - Leave by **2:09 PM** to arrive by 3:15 PM (after lunch)\n3. **Mei Foo \u2192 Lei Cheng Uk Estate:** 17 minutes - Leave by **4:58 PM** to arrive by 5:30 PM\n\n## \ud83d\udea8 **CONFLICT WARNING:**\nYou have a **tight connection** between HKUST Lesson 2 (ends 13:30) and your Job Interview (starts 15:15). With 1 hour 6 minutes travel time, you only have **39 minutes** for lunch and buffer time. Consider packing lunch or eating very quickly.\n\nWould you like me to create calendar events for your lunch and dinner times?"}

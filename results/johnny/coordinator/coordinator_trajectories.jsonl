This is tight but manageable if you go directly to the interview location.\n2. **Tight Connection:** After your HKUST Lesson 2, you need to leave immediately to catch transportation to Mei Foo for your 15:15 interview.\n3. **No Lunch Buffer:** I've scheduled lunch between your HKUST lessons (11:00-12:00) since the afternoon gap is too tight for a proper meal.\n\n## Recommendations:\n1. **Morning Departure:** Leave home by **7:50 AM** to arrive at HKUST by 9:00 AM.\n2. **Afternoon Transit:** Immediately after your 13:30 class ends, head to the minibus station to ensure you arrive in Mei Foo with enough time.\n3. **Evening:** Your dinner is scheduled after your tutorial ends at 19:30, giving you time to relax after a busy day.\n\nThe weather looks favorable with low rain chances, so no umbrella is necessary, but you might want to bring a light jacket as temperatures will be around 20-25\u00b0C."}

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\n* ### The stock market turned the corner following Thursday's rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia's quarterly report.  \nThe stock market turned the corner following Thursday's rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia's quarterly report. The S&P 500 closed at $6,539 on November 20, just points below its prior low from October 10\\. Since then, the entire market reversed higher -- and this time, stocks were not led by Information Technology, but rather by diverse sector and industry strength. While IT and semiconductors have bounced, some of the largest losers on Tuesday were AMD, NVDA, SMCI, VST, and NFLX (which all fell between 2.4% and 4.2%). The IT sector was near the bottom, with a 0.3% gain, with only Energy (XLE -0.6%) and (XLU -0.4%) worse off. As we have talked about in recent commentaries, Healthcare (XLV) led once again on Tuesday, with a 2.3% pop, followed by Discretionary (XLY +2.1%); Materials (XLB +1.5%); Staples (XLP + 1.4%); Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF), both rising 1.3%; Communication Services (XLC +1.1%); and Real Estate (XLRE +0.8%). So there was strength in many different sectors and industries, and rotation remains in gear as money flows from area to area but never moves to the sidelines. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 21-day exponential and 50-day simple averages, but ran right into the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. In addition, price ran right to prior support off the lows since late July -- which is now resistance in the 6,770 area. A pop over this region will likely put an end to the multi-month sloppy action and open the doors for new all-time highs during the last month of 2025\\. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\n* ### For the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start.  \nFor the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start. Technology, and more specifically, semiconductor and software stocks, led the downside once again. Weakness from the largest semi and software companies was evident, with NVDA off 3.7%, AVGO 1%, TSM 1.5%, AMD over 7%, MSFT 2%, ORCL 2.6%, PLTR almost 7%, and CRM 5%. It wasn't just the mega caps that were hit, with former leaders, some of which reported Q3 EPS, wrecked -- including ELF (-35%), DUOL (-25%), DASH (-17%), HOOD (-11%), and AXON, which fell 8% after Wednesday's 9% slide. OUCH! The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, falling below its 21-day exponential average (EMA) and with a minor 5-day/13-day EMA bearish crossover. Key support from the rising 50-day lies at 6,666, with chart support at 6,550 (from the recent low on October 10). The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) lost 1.9% and both broke their 21-day EMAs. The 50-day for the QQQ is at 601 with chart support at 589\\. Buying the dip (BTD) has taken on a different meaning since the April bottom. Dips were once considered multiple-week affairs, with the S&P 500 dropping 5% to 10%. The index has seen a daily drop of more than 1% nine times since April 7\\. Incredibly, it has rebounded the next day every signal time, with five of those occasions wiping out the loss from the previous day. One way to spot a potential trend change is to look for a technical clue known as a change in character. If the current very rapid BTD stops, that would be a change in character.

We believe that diversification across sectors is powering this bull market and is wider than discussed in the media and by overall investing commentary. We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function."

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights. Given the strategy's focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\n* ### Value Sectors  \nEach month, we examine at an aspect of sector investing. This month, we are looking at growth and valuation. Investors hunting for stocks that reasonably balance long-term growth prospects and current value characteristics might want to look at companies in the Healthcare, Financial, and Communication Services sectors. These are among the industry groups that are selling for (price/earnings)/(growth+yield) ratios at or below the S&P 500's ratio of 2.1\\. To generate the PEGY ratios, we use the P/E ratio for each sector based on forward earnings for the numerator. For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this in order to achieve a less-volatile earnings-growth rate trend. We then add the current yield to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.1%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1\\. Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the Consumer groups. Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our over-weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Communication Services. Our under-weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.\n* ### Daily \u2013 Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 11/05/2025  \nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\n* ### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 11/03/2025: Big-Cap High-Flyers  \nThe stock market keeps hitting all-time highs. We believe that diversification across sectors is powering this bull market and is wider than discussed in the media and by overall investing commentary. We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function."

We believe that diversification across sectors is powering this bull market and is wider than discussed in the media and by overall investing commentary. We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows.

The company was founded in 2003 and went public in June 2010 with an initial public offering at $17 per share. As of December 31, 2024, Tesla employed approximately 125.665 employees.

And while improved, the sentiment data is still far from the readings below 2.00 that are needed for a bullish call. By the number, the current Total (all exchanges) One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 6.02 versus 11.45 last week and 17.32 the week before that. The NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 3.40 versus 8.15 last week and 27.25 the week before that. The Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 9.21 versus 14.20 last week and 14.34 the week before that. While the trend is improving, it has not done so with enough strength to stop the deterioration in Vickers long-term (eight-week) ratios. Insider buying outpaced insider selling in two sectors over the past week. Insiders bought shares valued at $104,727 in the Real Estate sector, while selling none. Additionally, insiders bought shares worth $81,929 in the Energy sector, while selling none. Buying activity was also of note in Healthcare, as the value of the insider buying activity lagged the level of selling by a factor of just 2.04-times. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in Financials, with shares valued at $33 million sold versus $7.2 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Consumer Discretionary, and Information Technology. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Cohen & Steers Inc. (NYSE: CNS) and BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BL)"

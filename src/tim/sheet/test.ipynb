As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights. Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n* ### The stock market turned the corner following Thursday\\'s rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia\\'s quarterly report.  \\nThe stock market turned the corner following Thursday\\'s rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia\\'s quarterly report. The S&P 500 closed at $6,539 on November 20, just points below its prior low from October 10\\\\. Since then, the entire market reversed higher -- and this time, stocks were not led by Information Technology, but rather by diverse sector and industry strength. While IT and semiconductors have bounced, some of the largest losers on Tuesday were AMD, NVDA, SMCI, VST, and NFLX (which all fell between 2.4% and 4.2%). The IT sector was near the bottom, with a 0.3% gain, with only Energy (XLE -0.6%) and (XLU -0.4%) worse off. As we have talked about in recent commentaries, Healthcare (XLV) led once again on Tuesday, with a 2.3% pop, followed by Discretionary (XLY +2.1%); Materials (XLB +1.5%); Staples (XLP + 1.4%); Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF), both rising 1.3%; Communication Services (XLC +1.1%); and Real Estate (XLRE +0.8%). So there was strength in many different sectors and industries, and rotation remains in gear as money flows from area to area but never moves to the sidelines. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 21-day exponential and 50-day simple averages, but ran right into the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. In addition, price ran right to prior support off the lows since late July -- which is now resistance in the 6,770 area. A pop over this region will likely put an end to the multi-month sloppy action and open the doors for new all-time highs during the last month of 2025\\\\. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\\n* ### For the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start.  \\nFor the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start. Technology, and more specifically, semiconductor and software stocks, led the downside once again. Weakness from the largest semi and software companies was evident, with NVDA off 3.7%, AVGO 1%, TSM 1.5%, AMD over 7%, MSFT 2%, ORCL 2.6%, PLTR almost 7%, and CRM 5%. It wasn\\'t just the mega caps that were hit, with former leaders, some of which reported Q3 EPS, wrecked -- including ELF (-35%), DUOL (-25%), DASH (-17%), HOOD (-11%), and AXON, which fell 8% after Wednesday\\'s 9% slide. OUCH! The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, falling below its 21-day exponential average (EMA) and with a minor 5-day/13-day EMA bearish crossover. Key support from the rising 50-day lies at 6,666, with chart support at 6,550 (from the recent low on October 10). The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) lost 1.9% and both broke their 21-day EMAs. The 50-day for the QQQ is at 601 with chart support at 589\\\\. Buying the dip (BTD) has taken on a different meaning since the April bottom. Dips were once considered multiple-week affairs, with the S&P 500 dropping 5% to 10%. The index has seen a daily drop of more than 1% nine times since April 7\\\\. Incredibly, it has rebounded the next day every signal time, with five of those occasions wiping out the loss from the previous day. One way to spot a potential trend change is to look for a technical clue known as a change in character. If the current very rapid BTD stops, that would be a change in character.

We believe that diversification across sectors is powering this bull market and is wider than discussed in the media and by overall investing commentary. We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus\\' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function.', name='browse', id='3c74da2d-f69a-422f-838c-5cecbfa4647e', tool_call_id='call_00_UpgEPeeejOemWIN1VOEMzmao')]}\n",

One way to spot a potential trend change is to look for a technical clue known as a change in character. If the current very rapid BTD stops, that would be a change in character.

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights. Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n* ### Value Sectors  \\nEach month, we examine at an aspect of sector investing. This month, we are looking at growth and valuation. Investors hunting for stocks that reasonably balance long-term growth prospects and current value characteristics might want to look at companies in the Healthcare, Financial, and Communication Services sectors. These are among the industry groups that are selling for (price/earnings)/(growth+yield) ratios at or below the S&P 500\\'s ratio of 2.1\\\\. To generate the PEGY ratios, we use the P/E ratio for each sector based on forward earnings for the numerator. For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this in order to achieve a less-volatile earnings-growth rate trend. We then add the current yield to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.1%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1\\\\. Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the Consumer groups. Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our over-weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Communication Services. Our under-weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.\\n* ### Daily – Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 11/05/2025  \\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\\n* ### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 11/03/2025: Big-Cap High-Flyers  \\nThe stock market keeps hitting all-time highs.

We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus\\' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function.\\n* ### Third quarter 2025 profit down 31%; too early for an upgrade  \\nTesla Inc. manufactures and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems. The company was founded in 2003 and went public in June 2010 with an initial public offering at $17 per share. As of December 31, 2024, Tesla employed approximately 125.665 employees. It recently moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas from Palo Alto, California and its stock is a component of the S&P 500 index.\\n* ### While the weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is  \\nWhile the weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is noticeably improved from what was seen over the past two weeks, insiders clearly remain cautious. And while improved, the sentiment data is still far from the readings below 2.00 that are needed for a bullish call. By the number, the current Total (all exchanges) One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 6.02 versus 11.45 last week and 17.32 the week before that. The NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 3.40 versus 8.15 last week and 27.25 the week before that. The Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 9.21 versus 14.20 last week and 14.34 the week before that. While the trend is improving, it has not done so with enough strength to stop the deterioration in Vickers long-term (eight-week) ratios. Insider buying outpaced insider selling in two sectors over the past week. Insiders bought shares valued at $104,727 in the Real Estate sector, while selling none. Additionally, insiders bought shares worth $81,929 in the Energy sector, while selling none. Buying activity was also of note in Healthcare, as the value of the insider buying activity lagged the level of selling by a factor of just 2.04-times. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in Financials, with shares valued at $33 million sold versus $7.2 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Consumer Discretionary, and Information Technology. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Cohen & Steers Inc. (NYSE: CNS) and BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BL)', name='browse', id='0dfbf1f9-64fc-4a2b-99a4-3669321a4151', tool_call_id='call_02_qyRsNQli632ltsIVsMXVZU2m')]}\n",

As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, first focused on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. In time, the list of industries to avoid increased to include soft drinks, fast food, and oil and gas, among numerous others. Performance of initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \"sustainable\" business practices across all industries that can have an \"impact\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers\\' rights. Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n* ### The stock market turned the corner following Thursday\\'s rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia\\'s quarterly report.  \\nThe stock market turned the corner following Thursday\\'s rather large downside reversal, which just happened to coincide with the short-term disappointment over Nvidia\\'s quarterly report. The S&P 500 closed at $6,539 on November 20, just points below its prior low from October 10\\\\. Since then, the entire market reversed higher -- and this time, stocks were not led by Information Technology, but rather by diverse sector and industry strength. While IT and semiconductors have bounced, some of the largest losers on Tuesday were AMD, NVDA, SMCI, VST, and NFLX (which all fell between 2.4% and 4.2%). The IT sector was near the bottom, with a 0.3% gain, with only Energy (XLE -0.6%) and (XLU -0.4%) worse off. As we have talked about in recent commentaries, Healthcare (XLV) led once again on Tuesday, with a 2.3% pop, followed by Discretionary (XLY +2.1%); Materials (XLB +1.5%); Staples (XLP + 1.4%); Industrials (XLI) and Financials (XLF), both rising 1.3%; Communication Services (XLC +1.1%); and Real Estate (XLRE +0.8%). So there was strength in many different sectors and industries, and rotation remains in gear as money flows from area to area but never moves to the sidelines. The S&P 500 reclaimed its 21-day exponential and 50-day simple averages, but ran right into the key 61.8% retracement of the recent decline. In addition, price ran right to prior support off the lows since late July -- which is now resistance in the 6,770 area. A pop over this region will likely put an end to the multi-month sloppy action and open the doors for new all-time highs during the last month of 2025\\\\. (Mark Arbeter, CMT)\\n* ### For the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start.  \\nFor the second time this week, stocks were hit with consistent selling pressure as November is off to a rocky start. Technology, and more specifically, semiconductor and software stocks, led the downside once again. Weakness from the largest semi and software companies was evident, with NVDA off 3.7%, AVGO 1%, TSM 1.5%, AMD over 7%, MSFT 2%, ORCL 2.6%, PLTR almost 7%, and CRM 5%. It wasn\\'t just the mega caps that were hit, with former leaders, some of which reported Q3 EPS, wrecked -- including ELF (-35%), DUOL (-25%), DASH (-17%), HOOD (-11%), and AXON, which fell 8% after Wednesday\\'s 9% slide. OUCH! The S&P 500 fell 1.1%, falling below its 21-day exponential average (EMA) and with a minor 5-day/13-day EMA bearish crossover. Key support from the rising 50-day lies at 6,666, with chart support at 6,550 (from the recent low on October 10). The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 (QQQ) lost 1.9% and both broke their 21-day EMAs. The 50-day for the QQQ is at 601 with chart support at 589\\\\. Buying the dip (BTD) has taken on a different meaning since the April bottom. Dips were once considered multiple-week affairs, with the S&P 500 dropping 5% to 10%. The index has seen a daily drop of more than 1% nine times since April 7\\\\. Incredibly, it has rebounded the next day every signal time, with five of those occasions wiping out the loss from the previous day. One way to spot a potential trend change is to look for a technical clue known as a change in character. If the current very rapid BTD stops, that would be a change in character.

Given the strategy\\'s focus on leading management practices, we expect the growth curve for Sustainable Investing to again slope upward in the years ahead.\\n* ### Value Sectors  \\nEach month, we examine at an aspect of sector investing. This month, we are looking at growth and valuation. Investors hunting for stocks that reasonably balance long-term growth prospects and current value characteristics might want to look at companies in the Healthcare, Financial, and Communication Services sectors. These are among the industry groups that are selling for (price/earnings)/(growth+yield) ratios at or below the S&P 500\\'s ratio of 2.1\\\\. To generate the PEGY ratios, we use the P/E ratio for each sector based on forward earnings for the numerator. For the denominator, we average the growth rates for the past five years along with two years of forward estimates, this in order to achieve a less-volatile earnings-growth rate trend. We then add the current yield to approximate total return. As an example, the current S&P 500 P/E ratio is 21, the current yield is 1.1%, and the historical growth rate is 9%. The formula is 21/(1.2+9.0) = 2.1\\\\. Sectors with favorable growth and valuation characteristics, in addition to the three listed above, also include Energy and Materials. Premium-valued sectors with low growth rates include the Consumer groups. Based on our analysis of growth rates and valuations, along with other factors, we have established our over-weight sectors as Information Technology, Financial, Utilities, and Communication Services. Our under-weight sector is Consumer Discretionary. Our Market-Weight sectors include Energy, Consumer Staples, Healthcare, Materials, Real Estate, and Industrial.\\n* ### Daily – Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers for 11/05/2025  \\nThe Vickers Top Buyers & Sellers is a daily report that identifies the five companies the largest insider purchase transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions as well as the five companies the largest insider sales transactions based on the dollar value of the transactions.\\n* ### Argus Quick Note: Weekly Stock List for 11/03/2025: Big-Cap High-Flyers  \\nThe stock market keeps hitting all-time highs.

We believe that diversification across sectors is powering this bull market and is wider than discussed in the media and by overall investing commentary. We want to highlight some of the high-flying sectors and individual companies that are having a banner year outside of the strong upward driver of AI. As such, the following is a two-tiered list of companies in Argus\\' fundamental Universe of Coverage and highlight stocks that are seeing the highest gains from their 52-week lows. We used our Argus screener to find large caps above $250 billion in market cap, and then sorted by sector. We also note our rating and the percentage gains in these stocks. The first list includes non-tech companies, while the second includes the tech companies. Some in this list are technically not categorized as IT companies, but we moved them into this group as IT is their main function.\\n* ### Third quarter 2025 profit down 31%; too early for an upgrade  \\nTesla Inc. manufactures and sells electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems. The company was founded in 2003 and went public in June 2010 with an initial public offering at $17 per share. As of December 31, 2024, Tesla employed approximately 125.665 employees. It recently moved its headquarters to Austin, Texas from Palo Alto, California and its stock is a component of the S&P 500 index.\\n* ### While the weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is  \\nWhile the weekly insider-sentiment data from Vickers Stock Research is noticeably improved from what was seen over the past two weeks, insiders clearly remain cautious. And while improved, the sentiment data is still far from the readings below 2.00 that are needed for a bullish call. By the number, the current Total (all exchanges) One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 6.02 versus 11.45 last week and 17.32 the week before that. The NYSE One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 3.40 versus 8.15 last week and 27.25 the week before that. The Nasdaq One-Week Sell/Buy Ratio is 9.21 versus 14.20 last week and 14.34 the week before that. While the trend is improving, it has not done so with enough strength to stop the deterioration in Vickers long-term (eight-week) ratios. Insider buying outpaced insider selling in two sectors over the past week. Insiders bought shares valued at $104,727 in the Real Estate sector, while selling none. Additionally, insiders bought shares worth $81,929 in the Energy sector, while selling none. Buying activity was also of note in Healthcare, as the value of the insider buying activity lagged the level of selling by a factor of just 2.04-times. Meanwhile, the greatest level of selling occurred in Financials, with shares valued at $33 million sold versus $7.2 million bought. Selling activity was also of note in Consumer Discretionary, and Information Technology. This week, analysts at Vickers highlighted insider transactions of interest at Cohen & Steers Inc. (NYSE: CNS) and BlackRock Inc. (NYSE: BL)'}]},\n",

      "Since _most_ customers are looking for the best value and are not hard-core frame rate hounds, the affordable MSI Katana 15 HX has the widest appeal for most gamers. The RTX 5050 GPU proved to be a steady 1080p performer, and that's before considering DLSS 4, which enables more demanding titles and higher frame rates if desired. A ho-hum display and a limited 512GB SSD are the main concessions to keep the price down.\n",

When you are, it's capable of running new PC games smoothly with the help of DLSS.\n",

      "The HP Victus 15 starts well below $1,000, making it a great budget gaming laptop off the bat. Additionally, HP offers a wide range of configuration options, making it quite flexible for various budgets and needs. Our test model was a bump up from the base model to an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor, 16GB of memory, a 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4050 GPU for a reasonably capable entry-level gaming system.

      "## How to Choose a Gaming Laptop: Start With Your Budget\n",
      "\n",
      "No surprise here: The ultimate factor in your gaming laptop purchase decision will be how much money you have to spend. Gaming systems have higher-end components than run-of-the-mill consumer laptops, so their prices will be higher, but the range across the category is huge, from under a grand to nearly $5,000\\. [Budget gaming laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-cheap-gaming-laptops) start at around $800 and can go up to about $1,250\\. For that, you get a system that can play games at full HD resolution (1080p) with the settings turned down in demanding titles, or at maximum quality settings in simpler and/or older games. Storage will likely be a modest-capacity solid-state drive (SSD); a hard drive indicates an older model best avoided. An SSD as the boot drive is _always_ preferable. \n",
      "\n",
      "Want something better? Midrange systems give you smoother gameplay at high or maximum settings on a better-quality 1080p screen (which will support high refresh rates; more on that in a moment), and they should add support for [VR headsets](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vr-headsets). These models will range in price from around $1,250 to $2,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "High-end systems, meanwhile, should guarantee you smooth gameplay at 1080p and 1440p with graphics details maxed out, invariably on a high-refresh screen. They may even let you play at 4K resolution, if the screen and GPU supports it. A high-end model should also be able to power a [VR headset](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vr-headsets) and support additional external monitors. These machines tend to come with capacious [PCI Express SSDs](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pci-express-nvme-solid-state-drives-ssds), and they are priced above $2,000, often closer to $3,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, you can easily spend more than $3,000 on a gaming laptop, with some models (particularly the 18-inchers, when fully kitted out) approaching $5,000\\. A big, beautiful screen often calls for a big price tag and is often paired with the highest-end components.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some laptops in this class support QHD (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) and QHD-equivalent (2,560-by-1,600-pixel in 16:10 aspect ratio) screens, 4K screens, and unseen extras like ultra-efficient cooling fans to power top-end parts. Thanks to modern advancements, an increasing number of systems are even relatively thin and portable. With laptops in this tier, you'll either pay a premium for high-end performance in a thin chassis or pay for the most possible power in a chunkier build.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "## Which Component Matters Most for Gaming Laptops?\n",
      "\n",
      "While your budget will be the ultimate deciding factor, knowing which components to prioritize can be challenging. Unless you have no spending limit, you must choose where to compromise and where to double down between the graphics processing unit (GPU), central processing unit (CPU or processor), memory, storage, and display. We'll run through the different components below, in order of where to spend your cash.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1\\. GPU\n",
      "\n",
      "It's natural to ask, \"What is the best GPU for a gaming laptop?\" But that's not quite the right question for your shopping search. The \"best\" GPU overall will always be the fastest, most expensive AMD or Nvidia has to offer, so you should ask: \"What's the best GPU for my gaming goals?\" We only consider a laptop to be a gaming laptop if it has a discrete graphics chip from Nvidia or AMD (or, much less commonly, an Intel Arc GPU). \n",
      "\n",
      "A quick crash course for the uninitiated: The higher the suffix number in a GPU series, the more powerful it is. For example, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 will generally produce faster frame rates and higher-quality graphics than an RTX 4070, and so on down the stack. The \"40\" denotes the generation, so the latest GeForce RTX 50 series is preferable to the older RTX 40 series since; for example, the GeForce RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080\\. Nvidia dominates the field right now, currently producing discrete [GeForce RTX 50-series](https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-50-series-mobile-gpus-ai-rocket-fuel-gaming-laptops-ces-2025) mobile GPUs based on its latest \"Blackwell\" microarchitecture, though you'll still find RTX 40-series \"Ada Lovelace\" GPUs for the time being.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia's GeForce RTX 40 and 50 series GPUs carry an RTX designation (rather than the GTX name of old), a nod to the ray-tracing lightning technology that provides enhanced visuals with compatible games. This fancy real-time lighting effect looks impressive, but it is very demanding to run. ([See our primer on PC ray-tracing](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-ray-tracing-and-what-it-means-for-pc-gaming).)\n",
      "\n",
      "Combined with an AI-based rendering and upscaling technique called [DLSS](https://www.pcmag.com/news/testing-nvidias-dlss-20-higher-frame-rates-for-free), Nvidia GPUs can push ray-tracing at higher resolutions in the latest titles. Nvidia is continuously working on this technology, and the improvements in the latest edition, [DLSS 4](https://www.pcmag.com/news/i-tested-dlss-4-in-cyberpunk-2077-on-the-geforce-rtx-5090-and-heres-how), are a big part of the effectiveness of its 50-series GPUs. Depending on the laptop, demanding games may not hit 60 frames per second (fps) at 4K resolution, especially with ray-tracing active. \n",
      "\n",
      "But it's much more feasible for a laptop to manage both a high frame rate and high resolution with a top-end GPU's DLSS 4 and \"frame generation\" feature, which stitches AI-generated frames between GPU-rendered frames to increase frame rates. From DLSS 4 onward, in particular, Nvidia's biggest GPU performance gains likely will be achieved via DLSS, rather than via pure horsepower. This technology can help powerful laptops squeeze out extra performance at the highest settings, and, conversely, let [budget laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-budget-laptops) run cutting-edge games smoothly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lovelace and Blackwell laptop GPUs are not 1:1 performers in line with their desktop counterparts, but their performance is still respectable. We've found some sizable real-world performance variance between the same GPU in one laptop versus the same silicon in another, depending mostly on the power or wattage that laptop manufacturers allocate to the GPU. To see why this is, read our article comparing the [laptop versus desktop GeForce RTX 4090](https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-laptop-vs-desktop-compared-tested), and pay attention to the listed TGP on any given laptop GPU. This makes laptop shopping a bit more complicated than simply finding the GPU model in the spec sheet. Our hands on testing is more important than ever.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "As for the model hierarchy, high-priced notebooks with RTX 4080, RTX 4090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090 GPUs are exceptional performers at all resolutions. As mentioned, DLSS is recommended for running ray tracing at higher resolutions and visual settings, but these top-end 40- and 50-series GPUs are much more capable than the lower-tier chips (with and without the help of DLSS). Our first opportunity to test the mobile RTX 50 series in any capacity was with an [RTX 5090 in a Razer Blade 16](https://www.pcmag.com/news/geforce-rtx-5090-for-laptops-tested-fastest-mobile-gpu), where it proved its power, while an [RTX 5080 laptop](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/gigabyte-aorus-master-16) was our first full RTX 50-series review.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moving down the stack, Nvidia has RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5070, RTX 5060, and RTX 5050 GPUs. The [MSI Katana 15 HX](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/msi-katana-15-hx) was our first chance to see firsthand that even the entry-level RTX 5050 can get the job done at budget pricing, a big win for price-conscious shoppers. We haven't tested a high number of these recently released laptops yet, but we expect the RTX 5070 Ti to occupy the upper-midrange tier below the true premium systems, while the RTX 5070 will be a true midrange GPU.\n",
      "\n",
      "Like the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 will live in less expensive machines that define the top end of \"entry-level.\" Think of the RTX 5060 as a reliable, steady pick for 1080p laptops. These are your bread-and-butter laptops just above bargain-priced systems, which is the territory of the RTX 4050 and RTX 5050\\. The xx60 tier is meant for your mainstream, everyday gaming experience and doesn't presume to power all of the visual details higher-end gaming rigs can. \n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia is still the leading player in graphics, and while its rival, AMD, does sell alternatives, you won't find them nearly as often. AMD's current mobile generation is the [Radeon RX 7000M](https://www.pcmag.com/news/amd-unveils-radeon-rx-7000-series-mobile-gpus) line, but we've seen only a few of them since launch in gaming laptops. One interesting wrinkle you may have heard about: Intel and Nvidia are [joining forces](https://www.pcmag.com/news/shocker-intel-cpus-to-feature-built-in-nvidia-rtx-graphics) for new chips that, while not discrete GPUs, will be able to leverage system memory and Nvidia graphics chiplets for better-than-integrated graphics performance. These likely won't launch for some time, but they may be a factor in the lower end of the gaming market sometime in 2026 or 2027.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even with all the above complexity, we can still draw some basic conclusions about graphics performance. Today, a single midrange or high-end discrete GPU will let you play the latest AAA gaming titles on a 1080p screen with high-quality settings turned on and be fine for powering VR play. The RTX 3070 and 3080 made smooth 1440p gaming the norm, the RTX 40 series raised the baseline and made high-res gaming on laptops more plausible, and the RTX 50 series is doubling down on DLSS effectiveness.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2\\. CPU\n",
      "\n",
      "As you may have surmised from the GPU section, we have no one clear answer to someone asking, \"What CPU do I need for a gaming laptop?\" either, though there are clearer baselines. Intel's [13th Generation (\"Raptor Lake\") chips](https://pcmag.com/news/ces-2023-intel-raptor-lake-13th-gen-laptop-cpus) and AMD's [Ryzen 7000 processors](https://www.pcmag.com/news/phoenix-and-dragon-range-arrive-amd-outlines-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-some) dominated most of 2024, before Intel's [14th Gen \"Raptor Lake Refresh\" H](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2024-intel-shows-off-more-refreshed-raptor-lake-chips-for-laptops) and AMD's Ryzen 8000 chips launched and took over in several of our top picks. Unlike in the GPU space, you will see more AMD processor options out there, as the company's current offerings stack up well against Intel's chips.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intel also launched its [Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\"](https://www.pcmag.com/news/meteor-lake-architecture-detailed-what-to-know-about-intels-next-gen-cpus) and [\"Lunar Lake\"](https://www.pcmag.com/news/lunar-lake-first-tests-intels-ai-ready-core-ultra-2-chip-posts-nearly-24) chips with onboard AI processing, which will run [in a few gaming systems](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2024-hands-on-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-and-g16-gaming-laptops-slim-down), but won't be seen in most. You've likely seen the hype around Copilot+ PCs and Qualcomm's Snapdragon chips, but these AI processors are not relevant for gaming, at least for now.\n",

      "What you _are_ more likely to see are Intel's [\"Arrow Lake\" Core Ultra mobile](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-intels-2025-arrow-lake-core-ultra-chips-for-laptops-prioritize) processors, which bridge the gap between AI performance and general power; see our [first tests of those chips here](https://www.pcmag.com/news/arrow-lake-h-tested-intels-core-ultra-9-mobile-chip-vies-for-first-place). 2025 was a silicon onslaught from AMD, too, which brought us [Ryzen 9000 HX “Fire Range,](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-a-mountain-of-mobile-cpus-amd-2025-ryzen-9-x3d-ai-max-chips)”[ Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix Point,\" and Ryzen 200 processors](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-a-mountain-of-mobile-cpus-amd-2025-ryzen-9-x3d-ai-max-chips). The more AI-centric chips aren't primarily aimed at gaming laptops, but that's not to say you won't find them at all; a few of our picks (particularly high-end or cross-functional models) employ Ryzen AI and Core Ultra processors. The potent H and HX processors from AMD and Intel alike are the ones likely to appear in your favorite laptop lines as the year progresses, and our current list is a mix of these product lines.\n",

      "Many entry-level and midrange gaming systems sport 7-class Intel processors, with the most expensive flaunting 9-class. The most affordable systems settle for 5-class chips. In general, more cores and higher clock speeds bring better overall efficiency and much-improved performance on multithreaded tasks like media projects, but are less vital for gaming. Gaming usually sees less of a boost from multiple threads than many media tasks do, but having a beefier CPU certainly doesn't hurt.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have to choose between a deluxe CPU and a high-end GPU, however, go for the graphics. For example, we'd recommend getting a Core 5-class processor over a 7 if the money saved could go, say, toward an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU instead of an RTX 5050\\. Spending your money on the GPU makes more sense if gaming is your chief concern.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Look for Intel Core i5 processors in budget gaming systems, with Core i7 H or HX processors in midrange gaming laptops. The HX-series processors are higher-power and tend to show up in more expensive gaming laptops, such as the 14th Gen HX chips. Meanwhile, lower-power Core i7 U-series chips are designed for thinner, more portable, generally non-gaming machines. The most expensive, biggest gaming laptops for sale use Core i9 or Ultra 9 H-series processors, which are also superior for media tasks. Intel's newer Core Ultra Meteor, Lunar, and Arrow Lake processors drop the classic Intel \"i\" in the chip number but still have their own Ultra 5, 7, and 9 tiers, as well as designations like H series and V series. Of these, you'll mostly see H-class Arrow Lake chips (aka Core Ultra 200H series) in gaming laptops. A Core Ultra V- or U- series chip, in almost all cases, indicates a non-gaming-oriented machine. \n",
      "\n",
      "Then you have the AMD side, which we alluded to at the start of this discussion. As mentioned, AMD's chips long played second fiddle to Intel's offerings, but these days, Intel and AMD tug back and forth for performance supremacy, and you can largely follow the same 5-, 7-, and 9-tier logic when shopping AMD. AMD's Ryzen 7000 and 8000 chips go [toe-to-toe](https://www.pcmag.com/news/amd-ryzen-7000-mobile-tested-dragon-range-pushes-intel-for-cpu-speed-crown) with Intel's 13th and 14th Gen processors, making for fiercer competition. Any Ryzen 7000 or 8000, Ryzen AI 300 (with their own H and HX designations), or Intel 13th or 14th Gen Intel H-class chip should be a capable enough gamer under most circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3\\. RAM\n",
      "\n",
      "How much memory should you get? For gaming on Windows, demand at least 8GB of RAM. (In practice, no real gaming model will come with less.) That will give you some breathing room when switching back and forth between your gameplay window and your messaging app, but we'd save researching game tips for when you're not playing, as each successive browser tab you open eats into your RAM allotment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Memory capacities of 16GB are becoming increasingly standard for all but the least expensive laptops, particularly for gaming. With this, you can have your gaming session, a messaging app, several websites, a webcam, and streaming video active simultaneously. A budget gaming laptop should function okay with 8GB of RAM, but this amount is gradually being left behind, and you should be aware that some new laptops are not upgradable. You may be stuck with the amount of memory you order. For a midrange or enthusiast gaming laptop, 16GB is the minimum target; for most folks who aren't serious streamers or multitaskers, more than that is overkill. Higher-end gaming laptops will come with 32GB or more these days, which helps you multitask and run games at the highest settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "### 4\\. Screen\n",
      "\n",
      "This aspect has become increasingly complicated for gaming laptops, really boiling down to two questions: \"What is the best size for a laptop screen?\" and \"What is the best refresh rate?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "First, regarding display size, we're always talking about the diagonal distance from corner to corner. A 15.6-inch screen was the traditional sweet spot for a gaming laptop, but screens that measure 16 inches have gradually replaced them as the standard. You can buy models with larger displays, but this will almost certainly increase the weight to well beyond five pounds and put portability in question. \n",
      "\n",
      "Larger 18-inch laptops started to arrive in force in early 2023, and they've stuck around. These have all but replaced [17-inch laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-17-inch-laptops) as the largest laptop screen you'll find, a monitor-like experience that can substitute for a desktop permanently or when you're away from home. \n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Smaller, super-portable gaming laptops, usually around 14 inches, are also mildly popular. These are for gamers who know they'll be on the go frequently, but make sure you're OK with this smaller size if it will be your primary gaming PC.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of resolution, the default minimum has changed slightly as many laptop screens have shifted from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 16:10 ratio—screens that are just as wide, but a little taller. This changes the exact pixel count, but the resolutions are nearly functionally identical: You'll find either a \"full HD\" 1080p screen (1,920 by 1,080 pixels) in a 16:9 aspect ratio, or a full HD-equivalent 1200p (1,920 by 1,200 pixels) in a 16:10 aspect ratio.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those are generally the lowest resolutions you'll see, and for gaming laptops, this HD picture both looks sharp enough and is less taxing on your hardware. Higher resolutions have more pixels, making it more strenuous to run games, which in turn means you'll need more powerful laptop hardware. For this reason, many budget and mainstream laptops stick to 1080p (or 1200p) to ensure higher frame rates. \n",
      "\n",
      "More expensive laptops can give you those higher-than-full-HD resolutions, but choose wisely, as a resolution of 1440p/1600p (QHD) or 4K (UHD) can boost the real-world cost twice: first for the more advanced panel and second, for that higher-quality graphics chip you'll need to drive it to its full potential. As mentioned, look for a high-refresh-rate screen (as discussed earlier) if you want smoother visuals; they are now standard in gaming laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because they require the most potent GPUs for smooth gameplay at native resolution, gaming laptops with 4K screens (3,840 by 2,160 pixels in 16:9) are still an exception, and still expensive. Only the most powerful and pricey GPUs can render complex game animations at playable frame rates at 4K, so a 1080p or 1440p screen may be a better use of your money if all you do is play games. \n",
      "\n",
      "Even though the RTX 4080, 4090, 5080, and 5090 can handle 4K gaming much more ably than any laptop GPUs before them, we still don't generally think it's worth the cost to seek out 4K gaming in laptops unless you can spend big. Nvidia's DLSS and AMD's FSR can greatly improve frame rates at high resolutions, making 4K play more attainable than ever, but these resolutions are still generally recommended with more powerful desktop GPUs. The screens do look excellent, though, especially since they're sometimes paired with [OLED technology](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-oled-laptops). QHD is often a better resolution pairing for modern high-end GPUs on laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Now, to address the refresh rate question. Refresh rate is the number of times a screen refreshes itself per second and, thus, how \"fast\" it can display images. This will always be a relatively large number measured in hertz (Hz). Refresh rate functions alongside a video game's frame rate, measured in frames per second or fps; the Hz limit of your screen is the cap for how many frames per second can be rendered on the display. These together determine how smooth a game looks in practice: The computer's CPU and GPU can power a game at a specific frame rate, and your screen needs the Hz to display the images equally often.\n",
      "\n",
      "As with GPUs, you should consider what your target refresh rate is for your gaming goals. In the past, the power of a GPU like the RTX 5070 would look like overkill for gaming at \"just\" 1080p, but several new factors can absorb that extra potential. A [high-refresh-rate screen](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/does-your-gaming-laptop-need-a-high-refresh-rate-screen) is now the norm in any new gaming laptop, allowing for a full display of lofty frame rates to smooth out the perceived gameplay. You'll need a powerful graphics chip to leverage the benefits of a high-refresh panel with demanding games. You can identify machines like these by marketing lingo about, say, a 144Hz, 240Hz, or even 300Hz-plus screen. (A typical display on a laptop is a 60Hz panel, but new gaming models all have 144Hz-plus screens now.) \n",
      "\n",
      "A 144Hz panel is emerging as the most common, but we're also seeing some 240Hz and even 360Hz options in pricey models, all capable of displaying more than 60 frames per second (for example, up to 144fps in the case of 144Hz screens). This makes gameplay look smoother, but in many cases, only high-end GPUs can push those limits. Additionally, the aforementioned ray-tracing techniques (real-time lighting and reflection effects) are demanding to run, and as more video games implement the technology, the more you will want to flip them on.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Because of that, you have multiple reasons to opt for a high-end GPU, even if playing games at full HD (1080p) resolution doesn't look too demanding to you on paper. On the lower end, DLSS can also help less powerful hardware like the RTX 3050 or 4050 run or enable ray-tracing with limited downsides, so you're not totally out of luck if you can't afford the top-end chips. DLSS support is far from universal, but it's appearing in more and more titles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nvidia's G-Sync and AMD's FreeSync technologies are more down-to-earth. They help increase the quality of the gaming experience and smooth out frame rates by letting the laptop screen rewrite the image on-screen at a variable rate that depends on the output of the GPU (rather than the fixed rate of the screen). Look for support for one of those technologies if you're a stickler for perfectly rendered visuals. These technologies, collectively known as \"adaptive sync,\" tend to show up in pricier machines, with G-Sync being much more common in laptops.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 5\\. Storage\n",
      "\n",
      "How much storage space should you get in a gaming laptop SSD? These days, virtually every laptop comes with an SSD as the boot drive, and most have eliminated spinning [hard drives](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-external-hard-drives) entirely. SSDs speed up boot time, wake-from-sleep time, and the time it takes to launch a game and load a new level. Only older laptops will still have a hard drive as the boot drive.\n",
      "\n",
      "In large gaming laptops, it was previously common to see a small-capacity (256GB) SSD boot drive paired with a roomy (1TB or greater) secondary drive to store the bulk of your library. You may still find this kind of combination (it's rare now), but as higher-capacity SSDs have become more affordable, a single large SSD has become the norm. A 512GB SSD is the new default, even for new budget gaming laptops, with 1TB the mainstream amount. High-end systems will include a 2TB or larger SSD. New machines almost all implement their boot SSDs via the M.2 gumstick format.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Adding greater SSD capacity will undoubtedly increase the price, but it may be necessary, given how large modern game installations can be, so shop accordingly. We recommend at least a 512GB SSD if you can afford it; even then, your library will fill up your drive fast. If you see 256GB offered, that suggests an older model; bump up the capacity if you can, unless you know you only want to play smaller indie titles, perhaps. A too-small SSD can mean you're forever shuffling games on and off the drive. One workaround: Some larger gaming laptops include an extra M.2 SSD slot or two, in addition to the slot holding the boot drive; it may be possible to add an aftermarket M.2 drive and designate it as your secondary \"game\" drive if space runs low. \n",
      "\n",
      "### 6\\. Battery\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that high-end components tend to drain battery life, don't plan on taking any of these gaming rigs too far from a wall socket very often. Gaming laptops have improved on average regarding battery life, but it's generally not a long-lasting category. While many will now get you five, six, or seven hours, we still see more powerful laptops last only two to three hours in our rundown test. It's also something you can't especially tell when shopping for a laptop without looking at our reviews.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is, of course, before even playing games on battery. Doing so will drastically run down the charge on your laptop, meaning you'll be looking to plug in soon if you're playing on battery power. Between the fact that you're going to buy this laptop to play games mostly _and_ a battery run time that's short, even when you're not gaming, battery power just is not one of the priorities when buying a gaming laptop. Longer is still better than shorter, and we include at least one gaming pick among our list of overall [laptops with the best battery life](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-battery-life-laptops), but it's not a strength of gaming machines.\n",

      "## Buying the Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\n",
      "\n",
      "If you're shopping for a gaming system on a limited budget (in this case, between roughly $800 and $1,300), you must make some sacrifices. Maximizing power while staying within a limited price range is the goal, but you'll have to accept that some components won't be comparable with the more expensive laptops you'll see while browsing. That said, $1,200 is a reasonable ceiling for what some buyers are ready to spend on a gaming laptop, and you can still get an effective system for that much. (Check out our side roundup of [the best cheap gaming laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-cheap-gaming-laptops).)\n",
      "\n",
      "The main drop-off will be in the graphics since the dedicated graphics chip is one of the most expensive components in a machine and the primary factor in a laptop's gaming prowess. The graphics chip almost single-handedly defines the class of laptop you're dealing with, so pay attention to that part. Fortunately, even the less powerful GPU options these days are pretty capable.\n",
      "\n",
      "(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \n",
      "\n",
      "Past budget systems were equipped almost exclusively with those wallet-friendly Nvidia GeForce GTX GPUs we mentioned earlier. The RTX 4050 has been the go-to budget GPU of the past few years, with the rare RTX 4060 system sometimes found at budget pricing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The RTX 4050 was the budget baseline for some time, but the mobile RTX 5060 and RTX 5050 are now on the market. You'll be able to play smoothly at 1080p with an RTX 4050, just not at high settings in newer games; the RTX 5050 raises the bar, and makes even demanding titles playable with DLSS 4\\. All should be able to provide at least a decent level of VR play if that's your thing. An RTX 4060 is much more capable than an RTX 4050, so especially as the 50 series successors take over, look out for sales on older systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Processors are the next most significant difference. In a budget model, you'll likely get a capable Core 5 instead of a faster Core 7\\. Still, some of the benefits of a Core 7 machine aren't a major factor for gaming, but instead benefit [video editing](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-video-editing-software) and other creative uses. So a Core 5 will usually do the job for basic budget gaming. Over the past few years, we saw more AMD Ryzen CPUs in cheap, general-use laptops than in affordable gaming laptops, despite their adoption in some higher-end or ultraportable gaming systems. AMD GPUs are much less common in budget gaming laptops than Nvidia ones. You'll probably be sussing out Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs in the budget zone. \n",
      "\n",
      "Outside of the graphics card and processor, the other components should be closer to more expensive machines than you'd expect. SSD boot drives are the norm even in the cheapest new gaming laptops, though they may be small in capacity. The display will almost certainly be 1080p; grainy 1,366-by-768-pixel panels are now reserved only for the very cheapest non-gaming systems, and sharp 1440p isn't a budget resolution. The RAM will likely top off at 8GB in the cheapest gaming laptops, but you will find some (more ideal) 16GB laptops in this range.\n",

      "## What Else Do You Need to Up Your Game?\n",
      "\n",
      "Cutting-edge ports like [USB Type-C](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-usb-c-an-explainer) and [Thunderbolt 4](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-thunderbolt-4-why-this-new-interface-will-matter-in-pcs-in-2021) are beneficial now and will only be more so down the road, but look for at least two ordinary-shaped (aka, \"Type-A\") USB 3.0 ports so you can plug in an external mouse and a hard drive for your saved media files. There's also a load of extras like RGB key and chassis lighting, software performance modes, and Ethernet ports for wired downloads or online gaming.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you want to attach a wired VR headset to your rig, look for the right loadout of ports to accommodate it. You'll need a well-placed HDMI or DisplayPort video out (it depends on the headset, which one you'll need) and enough USB ports for a possible hydra-head of cabling. Other video ports, like DisplayPort or mini-DisplayPort (sometimes implemented over a USB-C port), will be helpful if you want to play games on an external display, but they aren't necessary if your laptop's screen is large enough.\n",

With this update, we added the Alienware 16X Aurora as our new Best Midrange Gaming Laptop, replacing the Acer Predator Triton Neo 16\\\\. Our remaining picks have been vetted for currency and availability. Since our last update, we have tested and evaluated three new [laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/categories/laptops)_ _for potential inclusion in this roundup and our other laptop roundups. We currently have more than a dozen laptops in PC Labs for evaluation, from makers including Acer, Asus, Lenovo, and Razer._\\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Capable everyday productivity performance\\n* RTX 5050 stands up to demanding games with DLSS 4\\n* Comfortable keyboard with RGB lighting\\n* Varied connectivity\\n* Just 512GB storage is tight for modern gaming\\n* Dim display\\n* Chunky for a 15-inch laptop\\n\\nSince _most_ customers are looking for the best value and are not hard-core frame rate hounds, the affordable MSI Katana 15 HX has the widest appeal for most gamers. The RTX 5050 GPU proved to be a steady 1080p performer, and that\\'s before considering DLSS 4, which enables more demanding titles and higher frame rates if desired. A ho-hum display and a limited 512GB SSD are the main concessions to keep the price down.\\n\\n**Budget-conscious gamers:** The MSI Katana 15 HX is the top choice for gamers looking for an affordable laptop. It meets most mainstream needs without deal-breaking compromises, thanks to its RTX 5050 GPU and DLSS 4 technology. The Katana will get you playing the most popular games for less.\\n\\n**Gamers in college:** This Katana budget laptop is also a good fit for college students who like to game. Its processor is faster than you usually see in this tier, so it will power your schoolwork more than adequately when you\\'re not gaming. When you are, it\\'s capable of running new PC games smoothly with the help of DLSS.\\n\\nClass  Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core i7-14650HX \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  16 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  512 GB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  15.6 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  1920 by 1080 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  IPS \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  None \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  144 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5050 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  8 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  1 by 14.1 by 10.3 inches \\n\\nWeight  5.29 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Home \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  8:11 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Affordable entry-level gaming\\n* Decent screen\\n* Impressive build quality\\n* Comfortable keyboard\\n* Excellent battery life\\n* Quiet fans\\n* Average gaming performance\\n* Some configurations leave budget territory\\n\\nThe HP Victus 15 starts well below $1,000, making it a great budget gaming laptop off the bat. Additionally, HP offers a wide range of configuration options, making it quite flexible for various budgets and needs. Our test model was a bump up from the base model to an AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS processor, 16GB of memory, a 1TB SSD, and an RTX 4050 GPU for a reasonably capable entry-level gaming system. The MSI Katana\\'s newer-generation RTX 5050 pushes more power, but the Victus 15\\'s low starting price, high build quality, excellent battery life, and comfortable keyboard are enough to keep it in consideration if money\\'s tight.\\n\\n**Money-strapped gamers:** The HP Victus 15 is the best budget-friendly gaming laptop for PC gamers. Its low starting price is important here—less expensive than almost any other gaming laptop we\\'ve reviewed—and you can configure it a bit if you have extra cash. \\n\\n**PC gamers who love options:** This HP laptop is a top pick if you\\'re looking for customization on a budget. HP\\'s website sells a variety of Victus 15 systems, including a few models tailored for configuration fiends. You can select from a variety of processors and other specifications to create a model that suits you directly.\\n\\nClass  Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  AMD Ryzen 7 8845HS \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  16 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  1 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  15.6 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  1920 by 1080 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  IPS \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  None \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  144 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  6 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  0.93 by 14.1 by 10 inches \\n\\nWeight  5.06 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Home \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  12:13 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Slim and sturdy design with aluminum lid\\n* Fast Intel processor and capable RTX 5060 GPU\\n* Bright and sharp 240Hz 1600p display\\n* Wide port selection\\n* A touch expensive for an RTX 5060\\n* No OLED option\\n* Single-zone RGB keyboard\\n\\nThis Alienware laptop is the king of the midrange due to a combination of build quality, feature set, and performance at a reasonable price. It starts at a decent price within the midrange band and can be configured upward for shoppers with larger budgets who like the build. Our test model features an Intel Core Ultra 7 255HX CPU and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU, midrange gaming essentials. The laptop comes with an aluminum lid, a bright and sharp 1600p screen, and useful ports. Additionally, Dell often runs deals on its web store, so look out for hundreds of dollars off this Alienware machine.\\n\\n**Gamers looking for an affordable upgrade:** This laptop is the best fit for gamers with a midrange budget who want more power without shelling out extra hundreds of dollars on a true enthusiast machine. A solid upgrade from an entry-level model, this Alienware machine\\'s RTX 5060 GPU (with the help of DLSS 4) can power virtually any modern game in style.\\n\\n**Gamers replacing a desktop:** The 16X Aurora is a good option for gamers looking to replace their desktop with a laptop.The 240Hz 16-inch 1600p display provides a monitor-like experience, serving as a quality primary or secondary panel. Plus, the aluminum build makes using it that much more satisfying.\\n\\nClass  Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core Ultra 7 255HX \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  16 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  1 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  16 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  2560 by 1600 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  IPS \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  G-Sync \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  240 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  8 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  0.92 by 14.05 by 10.45 inches \\n\\nWeight  2.57 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Home \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  5:39 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Blazing performance and gameplay\\n* Sharp, fast Mini LED 240Hz display\\n* Longer battery life than expected\\n* Effective cooling\\n* Tool-free RAM, SSD upgrades\\n* Competitively priced, but still expensive\\n* Loud fans when cooling\\n* Number pad overlay on the touchpad can be triggered by accident\\n\\nOur high-end pick is free from the budget restraints of other categories, and in this fiercely competitive tier, the Asus ROG Strix Scar 16 stands out. It manages to remain a decent value despite its price, and the performance, design, and feature set make it a winner for enthusiasts. The Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX and Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 in our test model made light work of our benchmark tests, and it\\'s up to the task for any real-world title. Additionally, it features a brilliant 240Hz 1600p mini LED display, long battery life, and tool-free RAM and storage upgradability.\\n\\n**Hard-core gamers with deep pockets:** This ROG Strix laptop works best for gamers willing to spend $3,000 or more. It\\'s expensive but maximizes that value with top-end parts and materials. Any modern game will run smoothly on this machine, and it has a boatload of memory, storage, and processing power.\\n\\n**Creatives and power users:** This laptop is also well-suited for creatives and professionals with high demands. You\\'ll find plenty of overlap between creators and gamers today. This laptop has as much muscle for crunching through media editing and data as it does for handling the latest games.\\n\\nClass  Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  32 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  2 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  16 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  2560 by 1600 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  Mini LED \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  G-Sync \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  240 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  16 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  1.21 by 13.9 by 10.6 inches \\n\\nWeight  6.28 pounds \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Pro \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  8:23 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Potent performance as configured\\n* Vivid OLED display\\n* Thin, lightweight design\\n* Powerful, crisp audio\\n* Plenty of extra ports\\n* Steep starting price\\n* Disappointing battery life\\n\\nThis version of the Zephyrus G16, based on Intel\\'s \"Arrow Lake\" platform, distinguishes itself from the [Ryzen model](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/asus-rog-zephyrus-g16-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-9) we also reviewed this year. With an even more powerful GPU (an RTX 5070 Ti, versus the other model\\'s RTX 4070), this is a dream laptop for demanding creative professionals who also play PC games. The 16-inch 1600p OLED screen is beautiful, the design is sleek and lightweight, and it comes with a range of useful connectivity options. The processor in our review model is well-equipped to handle demanding media editing and content creation workloads, while the GPU is equally capable of powering high-end gaming sessions and 3D content tasks.\\n\\n**Content creators moonlighting as PC gamers:** This gaming laptop is an excellent fit for creative professionals who also enjoy PC gaming. Video editors and graphic designers will come for the color-rich OLED display and speedy processor, wrap up their workday, and stay for the gaming-ready GPU. The Zephyrus\\' CPU power, memory, and sharp display make it a smart, albeit steeply priced, gaming laptop choice for people who need more than just fast frame rates from their hardware.\\n\\nClass  Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core Ultra 9 285H \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  32 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  2 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  16 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  2560 by 1600 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  OLED \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  None \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  240 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti \\n\\nGraphics Memory  12 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  0.69 by 13.9 by 9.7 inches \\n\\nWeight  4.3 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Pro \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  4:51 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Unparalleled build quality at its size\\n* Powerful enough for modern 60fps-plus gaming\\n* Sharp 120Hz 3K OLED screen\\n* Long battery life\\n* User-upgradable SSD\\n* High cost of entry\\n* Larger laptops at this price offer superior GPUs\\n\\nThe Blade 14 is our current favorite ultraportable gaming laptop, thanks to its exceptional combination of performance, style, and price. It costs a pretty penny—cheap laptops at this size are uncommon, and Razer leans premium to begin with—but it\\'s worth it if you can afford it. The high-quality chassis and slick style are unmatched in the gaming space, and the 120Hz 3K OLED panel only sweetens the pot. Its battery life is long, you can upgrade the SSD after purchase, and, of course, the laptop\\'s gaming performance meets expectations. Aside from the cost, it\\'s difficult to find much fault with the system, resulting in a fast, chic, and portable gaming machine.\\n\\n**Gamers on the go:** This gaming laptop fits well with gaming enthusiasts who travel a lot. The Blade 14 is not exactly a value play, but it is a device you\\'ll love if you frequently take your laptop with you. If you need a primary gaming PC that you can travel with over short or long distances, the Blade 14 is your best bet.\\n\\n**Frequent-traveling content creators:** This is a top portable option for editors and other media makers. These users often work on the road or frequently change location, making this mobile and premium laptop a great fit. Razer has long courted these users, and this edition seems to seal the deal.\\n\\nClass  Gaming, Ultraportable \\n\\nProcessor  AMD Ryzen AI 9 365 \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  32 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  1 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  14 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  2880 by 1800 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  OLED \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  G-Sync \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  120 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  8 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 7, Bluetooth 5.4 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  0.64 by 12.2 by 8.8 inches \\n\\nWeight  3.6 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Home \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  11:37 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Exceptional performance\\n* Dazzling mini-LED screen\\n* Potent audio\\n* Decent battery life\\n* Mostly plastic chassis\\n* Loud fans\\n* So-so keyboard\\n\\nWant the best big-screen experience that money can buy? Your best bet today is MSI\\'s Raider 18 HX AI, which goes all in for processing and graphics muscle. Our test model packs an Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX CPU, 64GB of memory, and an Nvidia RTX 5080 GPU, which unsurprisingly made mincemeat of our benchmark tests, posting staggering 3D and gaming results. The downside? It\\'s big, loud, and expensive, but that\\'s more or less table stakes at this size and power tier. A sharp mini LED screen and acceptable battery life for the size round out the system.\\n\\n**Power seekers:** This laptop is designed for gamers with deep pockets who demand maximum performance. The Raider is one of the most potent gaming laptops available, especially if frame rates and performance in the latest titles are your primary concerns. Even without an RTX 5090, it\\'s enough for virtually any current-day gaming scenario.\\n\\n**Gamers replacing a desktop:** This gaming laptop is a nearly perfect desktop replacement. Whether you are replacing an old tower or deciding between a new desktop or a laptop, the Raider will please. Its big display is like a desktop monitor, and its power level is about as potent as it gets in the mobile space.\\n\\nClass  Gaming, Desktop Replacement \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core Ultra 9 285HX \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  64 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  2 TB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested)  2 TB \\n\\nScreen Size  18 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  3840 by 2400 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  IPS \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  None \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  120 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Nvidia GeForce RTX 5080 Laptop GPU \\n\\nGraphics Memory  16 GB \\n\\nWireless Networking  Bluetooth 5.4, Wi-Fi 7 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  1.26 by 15.9 by 12.1 inches \\n\\nWeight  7.94 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Windows 11 Home \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  5:37 \\n\\n (Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n* Boosted productivity and gaming performance\\n* High-res IPS screen with 120Hz refresh rate\\n* Four-zone RGB keyboard with anti-ghosting\\n* Wi-Fi 6E and Ethernet\\n* Below-average battery life\\n* Non-touch display limits Android app use\\n\\nMany companies have tried to capitalize on the concept of cloud gaming. Now, the hardware and infrastructure are coming together in a handful of cloud-streaming Chromebook laptops with gamer-friendly details that set them apart from mainstream or ordinary Chromebooks. Part of a relatively new category of gaming laptop, the Acer Chromebook Plus 516 GE is Acer\\'s second-gen effort at a gaming Chromebook, and it\\'s our top pick. The performance is consistent across the board for gaming and general use; the build is top-quality for its price; the screen is sharp and peaks at a 120Hz refresh rate; and the keys even have RGB backlighting. Perhaps the gaming Chromebook trend won\\'t last, but if this machine is any indication, there\\'s a lot of promise here.\\n\\n**Gamers on very tight budgets:** This laptop is a good alternative for PC gamers who can\\'t splash out on a pricier Windows machine. Instead of the usual cheap gaming laptop, particularly cash-strapped shoppers can opt for this Chromebook to save hundreds more. A fast and reliable internet connection is a must, however, because your games will all be cloud-streamed.\\n\\n**Connected, casual gamers:** Acer\\'s Chromebook Plus 516 GE is best for casual PC gamers with a steady internet connection. Paired with quick and reliable internet service, this Chromebook can deliver top-end gaming experiences to casual gamers. This makes it ideal for a kid\\'s first gaming laptop, too.\\n\\nClass  Chromebook, Gaming \\n\\nProcessor  Intel Core i5-120U \\n\\nRAM (as Tested)  8 GB \\n\\nBoot Drive Type  SSD \\n\\nBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)  256 GB \\n\\nSecondary Drive Type \\n\\nSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested) \\n\\nScreen Size  16 inches \\n\\nNative Display Resolution  2560 by 1600 \\n\\nTouch Screen \\n\\nPanel Technology  IPS \\n\\nVariable Refresh Support  Yes \\n\\nScreen Refresh Rate  120 Hz \\n\\nGraphics Processor  Intel Graphics \\n\\nGraphics Memory \\n\\nWireless Networking  Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2 \\n\\nDimensions (HWD)  0.84 by 14.0 by 9.8 inches \\n\\nWeight  3.75 lbs \\n\\nOperating System  Chrome OS \\n\\nTested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)  9:16 \\n\\n![Newsletter Icon](https://www.pcmag.com/images/newsletter-envelope.svg)\\n\\n![Newsletter Icon](https://www.pcmag.com/images/newsletter-envelope.svg) \\n\\nGet Our Best Stories! \\n\\n###  All the Latest Tech, Tested by Our Experts\\n\\n![Lab Report Newsletter Image](https://i.pcmag.com/imagery/newsletters/17709142-contextual.fit_lpad.size_250x140.v1752614027.png) \\n\\nThanks for signing up!\\n\\nYour subscription has been confirmed.

Gaming systems have higher-end components than run-of-the-mill consumer laptops, so their prices will be higher, but the range across the category is huge, from under a grand to nearly $5,000\\\\. [Budget gaming laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-cheap-gaming-laptops) start at around $800 and can go up to about $1,250\\\\. For that, you get a system that can play games at full HD resolution (1080p) with the settings turned down in demanding titles, or at maximum quality settings in simpler and/or older games. Storage will likely be a modest-capacity solid-state drive (SSD); a hard drive indicates an older model best avoided. An SSD as the boot drive is _always_ preferable. \\n\\nWant something better? Midrange systems give you smoother gameplay at high or maximum settings on a better-quality 1080p screen (which will support high refresh rates; more on that in a moment), and they should add support for [VR headsets](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vr-headsets). These models will range in price from around $1,250 to $2,000.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nHigh-end systems, meanwhile, should guarantee you smooth gameplay at 1080p and 1440p with graphics details maxed out, invariably on a high-refresh screen. They may even let you play at 4K resolution, if the screen and GPU supports it. A high-end model should also be able to power a [VR headset](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-vr-headsets) and support additional external monitors. These machines tend to come with capacious [PCI Express SSDs](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pci-express-nvme-solid-state-drives-ssds), and they are priced above $2,000, often closer to $3,000.\\n\\nStill, you can easily spend more than $3,000 on a gaming laptop, with some models (particularly the 18-inchers, when fully kitted out) approaching $5,000\\\\. A big, beautiful screen often calls for a big price tag and is often paired with the highest-end components.\\n\\nSome laptops in this class support QHD (2,560-by-1,440-pixel) and QHD-equivalent (2,560-by-1,600-pixel in 16:10 aspect ratio) screens, 4K screens, and unseen extras like ultra-efficient cooling fans to power top-end parts. Thanks to modern advancements, an increasing number of systems are even relatively thin and portable. With laptops in this tier, you\\'ll either pay a premium for high-end performance in a thin chassis or pay for the most possible power in a chunkier build.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Which Component Matters Most for Gaming Laptops?\\n\\nWhile your budget will be the ultimate deciding factor, knowing which components to prioritize can be challenging. Unless you have no spending limit, you must choose where to compromise and where to double down between the graphics processing unit (GPU), central processing unit (CPU or processor), memory, storage, and display. We\\'ll run through the different components below, in order of where to spend your cash.\\n\\n### 1\\\\. GPU\\n\\nIt\\'s natural to ask, \"What is the best GPU for a gaming laptop?\" But that\\'s not quite the right question for your shopping search. The \"best\" GPU overall will always be the fastest, most expensive AMD or Nvidia has to offer, so you should ask: \"What\\'s the best GPU for my gaming goals?\" We only consider a laptop to be a gaming laptop if it has a discrete graphics chip from Nvidia or AMD (or, much less commonly, an Intel Arc GPU). \\n\\nA quick crash course for the uninitiated: The higher the suffix number in a GPU series, the more powerful it is. For example, an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4080 will generally produce faster frame rates and higher-quality graphics than an RTX 4070, and so on down the stack. The \"40\" denotes the generation, so the latest GeForce RTX 50 series is preferable to the older RTX 40 series since; for example, the GeForce RTX 5080 is the successor to the RTX 4080\\\\. Nvidia dominates the field right now, currently producing discrete [GeForce RTX 50-series](https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-50-series-mobile-gpus-ai-rocket-fuel-gaming-laptops-ces-2025) mobile GPUs based on its latest \"Blackwell\" microarchitecture, though you\\'ll still find RTX 40-series \"Ada Lovelace\" GPUs for the time being.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nNvidia\\'s GeForce RTX 40 and 50 series GPUs carry an RTX designation (rather than the GTX name of old), a nod to the ray-tracing lightning technology that provides enhanced visuals with compatible games. This fancy real-time lighting effect looks impressive, but it is very demanding to run. ([See our primer on PC ray-tracing](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-ray-tracing-and-what-it-means-for-pc-gaming).)\\n\\nCombined with an AI-based rendering and upscaling technique called [DLSS](https://www.pcmag.com/news/testing-nvidias-dlss-20-higher-frame-rates-for-free), Nvidia GPUs can push ray-tracing at higher resolutions in the latest titles. Nvidia is continuously working on this technology, and the improvements in the latest edition, [DLSS 4](https://www.pcmag.com/news/i-tested-dlss-4-in-cyberpunk-2077-on-the-geforce-rtx-5090-and-heres-how), are a big part of the effectiveness of its 50-series GPUs. Depending on the laptop, demanding games may not hit 60 frames per second (fps) at 4K resolution, especially with ray-tracing active. \\n\\nBut it\\'s much more feasible for a laptop to manage both a high frame rate and high resolution with a top-end GPU\\'s DLSS 4 and \"frame generation\" feature, which stitches AI-generated frames between GPU-rendered frames to increase frame rates. From DLSS 4 onward, in particular, Nvidia\\'s biggest GPU performance gains likely will be achieved via DLSS, rather than via pure horsepower. This technology can help powerful laptops squeeze out extra performance at the highest settings, and, conversely, let [budget laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-budget-laptops) run cutting-edge games smoothly.\\n\\nLovelace and Blackwell laptop GPUs are not 1:1 performers in line with their desktop counterparts, but their performance is still respectable. We\\'ve found some sizable real-world performance variance between the same GPU in one laptop versus the same silicon in another, depending mostly on the power or wattage that laptop manufacturers allocate to the GPU. To see why this is, read our article comparing the [laptop versus desktop GeForce RTX 4090](https://www.pcmag.com/news/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4090-laptop-vs-desktop-compared-tested), and pay attention to the listed TGP on any given laptop GPU. This makes laptop shopping a bit more complicated than simply finding the GPU model in the spec sheet. Our hands on testing is more important than ever.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nAs for the model hierarchy, high-priced notebooks with RTX 4080, RTX 4090, RTX 5080, and RTX 5090 GPUs are exceptional performers at all resolutions. As mentioned, DLSS is recommended for running ray tracing at higher resolutions and visual settings, but these top-end 40- and 50-series GPUs are much more capable than the lower-tier chips (with and without the help of DLSS). Our first opportunity to test the mobile RTX 50 series in any capacity was with an [RTX 5090 in a Razer Blade 16](https://www.pcmag.com/news/geforce-rtx-5090-for-laptops-tested-fastest-mobile-gpu), where it proved its power, while an [RTX 5080 laptop](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/gigabyte-aorus-master-16) was our first full RTX 50-series review.\\n\\nMoving down the stack, Nvidia has RTX 5070 Ti, RTX 5070, RTX 5060, and RTX 5050 GPUs. The [MSI Katana 15 HX](https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/msi-katana-15-hx) was our first chance to see firsthand that even the entry-level RTX 5050 can get the job done at budget pricing, a big win for price-conscious shoppers. We haven\\'t tested a high number of these recently released laptops yet, but we expect the RTX 5070 Ti to occupy the upper-midrange tier below the true premium systems, while the RTX 5070 will be a true midrange GPU.\\n\\nLike the RTX 4060, the RTX 5060 will live in less expensive machines that define the top end of \"entry-level.\" Think of the RTX 5060 as a reliable, steady pick for 1080p laptops. These are your bread-and-butter laptops just above bargain-priced systems, which is the territory of the RTX 4050 and RTX 5050\\\\. The xx60 tier is meant for your mainstream, everyday gaming experience and doesn\\'t presume to power all of the visual details higher-end gaming rigs can. \\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nNvidia is still the leading player in graphics, and while its rival, AMD, does sell alternatives, you won\\'t find them nearly as often. AMD\\'s current mobile generation is the [Radeon RX 7000M](https://www.pcmag.com/news/amd-unveils-radeon-rx-7000-series-mobile-gpus) line, but we\\'ve seen only a few of them since launch in gaming laptops. One interesting wrinkle you may have heard about: Intel and Nvidia are [joining forces](https://www.pcmag.com/news/shocker-intel-cpus-to-feature-built-in-nvidia-rtx-graphics) for new chips that, while not discrete GPUs, will be able to leverage system memory and Nvidia graphics chiplets for better-than-integrated graphics performance. These likely won\\'t launch for some time, but they may be a factor in the lower end of the gaming market sometime in 2026 or 2027.\\n\\nEven with all the above complexity, we can still draw some basic conclusions about graphics performance. Today, a single midrange or high-end discrete GPU will let you play the latest AAA gaming titles on a 1080p screen with high-quality settings turned on and be fine for powering VR play. The RTX 3070 and 3080 made smooth 1440p gaming the norm, the RTX 40 series raised the baseline and made high-res gaming on laptops more plausible, and the RTX 50 series is doubling down on DLSS effectiveness.\\n\\n### 2\\\\. CPU\\n\\nAs you may have surmised from the GPU section, we have no one clear answer to someone asking, \"What CPU do I need for a gaming laptop?\" either, though there are clearer baselines. Intel\\'s [13th Generation (\"Raptor Lake\") chips](https://pcmag.com/news/ces-2023-intel-raptor-lake-13th-gen-laptop-cpus) and AMD\\'s [Ryzen 7000 processors](https://www.pcmag.com/news/phoenix-and-dragon-range-arrive-amd-outlines-ryzen-7000-mobile-cpus-some) dominated most of 2024, before Intel\\'s [14th Gen \"Raptor Lake Refresh\" H](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2024-intel-shows-off-more-refreshed-raptor-lake-chips-for-laptops) and AMD\\'s Ryzen 8000 chips launched and took over in several of our top picks. Unlike in the GPU space, you will see more AMD processor options out there, as the company\\'s current offerings stack up well against Intel\\'s chips.\\n\\nIntel also launched its [Core Ultra \"Meteor Lake\"](https://www.pcmag.com/news/meteor-lake-architecture-detailed-what-to-know-about-intels-next-gen-cpus) and [\"Lunar Lake\"](https://www.pcmag.com/news/lunar-lake-first-tests-intels-ai-ready-core-ultra-2-chip-posts-nearly-24) chips with onboard AI processing, which will run [in a few gaming systems](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2024-hands-on-asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-and-g16-gaming-laptops-slim-down), but won\\'t be seen in most. You\\'ve likely seen the hype around Copilot+ PCs and Qualcomm\\'s Snapdragon chips, but these AI processors are not relevant for gaming, at least for now.\\n\\nWhat you _are_ more likely to see are Intel\\'s [\"Arrow Lake\" Core Ultra mobile](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-intels-2025-arrow-lake-core-ultra-chips-for-laptops-prioritize) processors, which bridge the gap between AI performance and general power; see our [first tests of those chips here](https://www.pcmag.com/news/arrow-lake-h-tested-intels-core-ultra-9-mobile-chip-vies-for-first-place). 2025 was a silicon onslaught from AMD, too, which brought us [Ryzen 9000 HX “Fire Range,](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-a-mountain-of-mobile-cpus-amd-2025-ryzen-9-x3d-ai-max-chips)”[ Ryzen AI 300 \"Strix Point,\" and Ryzen 200 processors](https://www.pcmag.com/news/ces-2025-a-mountain-of-mobile-cpus-amd-2025-ryzen-9-x3d-ai-max-chips). The more AI-centric chips aren\\'t primarily aimed at gaming laptops, but that\\'s not to say you won\\'t find them at all; a few of our picks (particularly high-end or cross-functional models) employ Ryzen AI and Core Ultra processors. The potent H and HX processors from AMD and Intel alike are the ones likely to appear in your favorite laptop lines as the year progresses, and our current list is a mix of these product lines.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nMany entry-level and midrange gaming systems sport 7-class Intel processors, with the most expensive flaunting 9-class. The most affordable systems settle for 5-class chips. In general, more cores and higher clock speeds bring better overall efficiency and much-improved performance on multithreaded tasks like media projects, but are less vital for gaming. Gaming usually sees less of a boost from multiple threads than many media tasks do, but having a beefier CPU certainly doesn\\'t hurt.\\n\\nIf you have to choose between a deluxe CPU and a high-end GPU, however, go for the graphics. For example, we\\'d recommend getting a Core 5-class processor over a 7 if the money saved could go, say, toward an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5060 GPU instead of an RTX 5050\\\\. Spending your money on the GPU makes more sense if gaming is your chief concern.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nLook for Intel Core i5 processors in budget gaming systems, with Core i7 H or HX processors in midrange gaming laptops. The HX-series processors are higher-power and tend to show up in more expensive gaming laptops, such as the 14th Gen HX chips. Meanwhile, lower-power Core i7 U-series chips are designed for thinner, more portable, generally non-gaming machines. The most expensive, biggest gaming laptops for sale use Core i9 or Ultra 9 H-series processors, which are also superior for media tasks. Intel\\'s newer Core Ultra Meteor, Lunar, and Arrow Lake processors drop the classic Intel \"i\" in the chip number but still have their own Ultra 5, 7, and 9 tiers, as well as designations like H series and V series. Of these, you\\'ll mostly see H-class Arrow Lake chips (aka Core Ultra 200H series) in gaming laptops. A Core Ultra V- or U- series chip, in almost all cases, indicates a non-gaming-oriented machine. \\n\\nThen you have the AMD side, which we alluded to at the start of this discussion. As mentioned, AMD\\'s chips long played second fiddle to Intel\\'s offerings, but these days, Intel and AMD tug back and forth for performance supremacy, and you can largely follow the same 5-, 7-, and 9-tier logic when shopping AMD. AMD\\'s Ryzen 7000 and 8000 chips go [toe-to-toe](https://www.pcmag.com/news/amd-ryzen-7000-mobile-tested-dragon-range-pushes-intel-for-cpu-speed-crown) with Intel\\'s 13th and 14th Gen processors, making for fiercer competition. Any Ryzen 7000 or 8000, Ryzen AI 300 (with their own H and HX designations), or Intel 13th or 14th Gen Intel H-class chip should be a capable enough gamer under most circumstances.\\n\\n### 3\\\\. RAM\\n\\nHow much memory should you get? For gaming on Windows, demand at least 8GB of RAM. (In practice, no real gaming model will come with less.) That will give you some breathing room when switching back and forth between your gameplay window and your messaging app, but we\\'d save researching game tips for when you\\'re not playing, as each successive browser tab you open eats into your RAM allotment.\\n\\nMemory capacities of 16GB are becoming increasingly standard for all but the least expensive laptops, particularly for gaming. With this, you can have your gaming session, a messaging app, several websites, a webcam, and streaming video active simultaneously. A budget gaming laptop should function okay with 8GB of RAM, but this amount is gradually being left behind, and you should be aware that some new laptops are not upgradable. You may be stuck with the amount of memory you order. For a midrange or enthusiast gaming laptop, 16GB is the minimum target; for most folks who aren\\'t serious streamers or multitaskers, more than that is overkill. Higher-end gaming laptops will come with 32GB or more these days, which helps you multitask and run games at the highest settings.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\n### 4\\\\. Screen\\n\\nThis aspect has become increasingly complicated for gaming laptops, really boiling down to two questions: \"What is the best size for a laptop screen?\" and \"What is the best refresh rate?\"\\n\\nFirst, regarding display size, we\\'re always talking about the diagonal distance from corner to corner. A 15.6-inch screen was the traditional sweet spot for a gaming laptop, but screens that measure 16 inches have gradually replaced them as the standard. You can buy models with larger displays, but this will almost certainly increase the weight to well beyond five pounds and put portability in question. \\n\\nLarger 18-inch laptops started to arrive in force in early 2023, and they\\'ve stuck around. These have all but replaced [17-inch laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-17-inch-laptops) as the largest laptop screen you\\'ll find, a monitor-like experience that can substitute for a desktop permanently or when you\\'re away from home. \\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nSmaller, super-portable gaming laptops, usually around 14 inches, are also mildly popular. These are for gamers who know they\\'ll be on the go frequently, but make sure you\\'re OK with this smaller size if it will be your primary gaming PC.\\n\\nIn terms of resolution, the default minimum has changed slightly as many laptop screens have shifted from a 16:9 aspect ratio to a 16:10 ratio—screens that are just as wide, but a little taller. This changes the exact pixel count, but the resolutions are nearly functionally identical: You\\'ll find either a \"full HD\" 1080p screen (1,920 by 1,080 pixels) in a 16:9 aspect ratio, or a full HD-equivalent 1200p (1,920 by 1,200 pixels) in a 16:10 aspect ratio.\\n\\nThose are generally the lowest resolutions you\\'ll see, and for gaming laptops, this HD picture both looks sharp enough and is less taxing on your hardware. Higher resolutions have more pixels, making it more strenuous to run games, which in turn means you\\'ll need more powerful laptop hardware. For this reason, many budget and mainstream laptops stick to 1080p (or 1200p) to ensure higher frame rates. \\n\\nMore expensive laptops can give you those higher-than-full-HD resolutions, but choose wisely, as a resolution of 1440p/1600p (QHD) or 4K (UHD) can boost the real-world cost twice: first for the more advanced panel and second, for that higher-quality graphics chip you\\'ll need to drive it to its full potential. As mentioned, look for a high-refresh-rate screen (as discussed earlier) if you want smoother visuals; they are now standard in gaming laptops.\\n\\nBecause they require the most potent GPUs for smooth gameplay at native resolution, gaming laptops with 4K screens (3,840 by 2,160 pixels in 16:9) are still an exception, and still expensive. Only the most powerful and pricey GPUs can render complex game animations at playable frame rates at 4K, so a 1080p or 1440p screen may be a better use of your money if all you do is play games. \\n\\nEven though the RTX 4080, 4090, 5080, and 5090 can handle 4K gaming much more ably than any laptop GPUs before them, we still don\\'t generally think it\\'s worth the cost to seek out 4K gaming in laptops unless you can spend big. Nvidia\\'s DLSS and AMD\\'s FSR can greatly improve frame rates at high resolutions, making 4K play more attainable than ever, but these resolutions are still generally recommended with more powerful desktop GPUs. The screens do look excellent, though, especially since they\\'re sometimes paired with [OLED technology](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-oled-laptops). QHD is often a better resolution pairing for modern high-end GPUs on laptops.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nNow, to address the refresh rate question. Refresh rate is the number of times a screen refreshes itself per second and, thus, how \"fast\" it can display images. This will always be a relatively large number measured in hertz (Hz). Refresh rate functions alongside a video game\\'s frame rate, measured in frames per second or fps; the Hz limit of your screen is the cap for how many frames per second can be rendered on the display. These together determine how smooth a game looks in practice: The computer\\'s CPU and GPU can power a game at a specific frame rate, and your screen needs the Hz to display the images equally often.\\n\\nAs with GPUs, you should consider what your target refresh rate is for your gaming goals. In the past, the power of a GPU like the RTX 5070 would look like overkill for gaming at \"just\" 1080p, but several new factors can absorb that extra potential. A [high-refresh-rate screen](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/does-your-gaming-laptop-need-a-high-refresh-rate-screen) is now the norm in any new gaming laptop, allowing for a full display of lofty frame rates to smooth out the perceived gameplay. You\\'ll need a powerful graphics chip to leverage the benefits of a high-refresh panel with demanding games. You can identify machines like these by marketing lingo about, say, a 144Hz, 240Hz, or even 300Hz-plus screen. (A typical display on a laptop is a 60Hz panel, but new gaming models all have 144Hz-plus screens now.) \\n\\nA 144Hz panel is emerging as the most common, but we\\'re also seeing some 240Hz and even 360Hz options in pricey models, all capable of displaying more than 60 frames per second (for example, up to 144fps in the case of 144Hz screens). This makes gameplay look smoother, but in many cases, only high-end GPUs can push those limits. Additionally, the aforementioned ray-tracing techniques (real-time lighting and reflection effects) are demanding to run, and as more video games implement the technology, the more you will want to flip them on.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nBecause of that, you have multiple reasons to opt for a high-end GPU, even if playing games at full HD (1080p) resolution doesn\\'t look too demanding to you on paper. On the lower end, DLSS can also help less powerful hardware like the RTX 3050 or 4050 run or enable ray-tracing with limited downsides, so you\\'re not totally out of luck if you can\\'t afford the top-end chips. DLSS support is far from universal, but it\\'s appearing in more and more titles.\\n\\nNvidia\\'s G-Sync and AMD\\'s FreeSync technologies are more down-to-earth. They help increase the quality of the gaming experience and smooth out frame rates by letting the laptop screen rewrite the image on-screen at a variable rate that depends on the output of the GPU (rather than the fixed rate of the screen). Look for support for one of those technologies if you\\'re a stickler for perfectly rendered visuals. These technologies, collectively known as \"adaptive sync,\" tend to show up in pricier machines, with G-Sync being much more common in laptops.\\n\\n### 5\\\\. Storage\\n\\nHow much storage space should you get in a gaming laptop SSD? These days, virtually every laptop comes with an SSD as the boot drive, and most have eliminated spinning [hard drives](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-external-hard-drives) entirely. SSDs speed up boot time, wake-from-sleep time, and the time it takes to launch a game and load a new level. Only older laptops will still have a hard drive as the boot drive.\\n\\nIn large gaming laptops, it was previously common to see a small-capacity (256GB) SSD boot drive paired with a roomy (1TB or greater) secondary drive to store the bulk of your library. You may still find this kind of combination (it\\'s rare now), but as higher-capacity SSDs have become more affordable, a single large SSD has become the norm. A 512GB SSD is the new default, even for new budget gaming laptops, with 1TB the mainstream amount. High-end systems will include a 2TB or larger SSD. New machines almost all implement their boot SSDs via the M.2 gumstick format.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nAdding greater SSD capacity will undoubtedly increase the price, but it may be necessary, given how large modern game installations can be, so shop accordingly. We recommend at least a 512GB SSD if you can afford it; even then, your library will fill up your drive fast. If you see 256GB offered, that suggests an older model; bump up the capacity if you can, unless you know you only want to play smaller indie titles, perhaps. A too-small SSD can mean you\\'re forever shuffling games on and off the drive. One workaround: Some larger gaming laptops include an extra M.2 SSD slot or two, in addition to the slot holding the boot drive; it may be possible to add an aftermarket M.2 drive and designate it as your secondary \"game\" drive if space runs low. \\n\\n### 6\\\\. Battery\\n\\nGiven that high-end components tend to drain battery life, don\\'t plan on taking any of these gaming rigs too far from a wall socket very often. Gaming laptops have improved on average regarding battery life, but it\\'s generally not a long-lasting category. While many will now get you five, six, or seven hours, we still see more powerful laptops last only two to three hours in our rundown test. It\\'s also something you can\\'t especially tell when shopping for a laptop without looking at our reviews.\\n\\nThis is, of course, before even playing games on battery. Doing so will drastically run down the charge on your laptop, meaning you\\'ll be looking to plug in soon if you\\'re playing on battery power. Between the fact that you\\'re going to buy this laptop to play games mostly _and_ a battery run time that\\'s short, even when you\\'re not gaming, battery power just is not one of the priorities when buying a gaming laptop. Longer is still better than shorter, and we include at least one gaming pick among our list of overall [laptops with the best battery life](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-battery-life-laptops), but it\\'s not a strength of gaming machines.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Buying the Best Cheap Gaming Laptop\\n\\nIf you\\'re shopping for a gaming system on a limited budget (in this case, between roughly $800 and $1,300), you must make some sacrifices. Maximizing power while staying within a limited price range is the goal, but you\\'ll have to accept that some components won\\'t be comparable with the more expensive laptops you\\'ll see while browsing. That said, $1,200 is a reasonable ceiling for what some buyers are ready to spend on a gaming laptop, and you can still get an effective system for that much. (Check out our side roundup of [the best cheap gaming laptops](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-cheap-gaming-laptops).)\\n\\nThe main drop-off will be in the graphics since the dedicated graphics chip is one of the most expensive components in a machine and the primary factor in a laptop\\'s gaming prowess. The graphics chip almost single-handedly defines the class of laptop you\\'re dealing with, so pay attention to that part. Fortunately, even the less powerful GPU options these days are pretty capable.\\n\\n(Credit: Joseph Maldonado) \\n\\nPast budget systems were equipped almost exclusively with those wallet-friendly Nvidia GeForce GTX GPUs we mentioned earlier. The RTX 4050 has been the go-to budget GPU of the past few years, with the rare RTX 4060 system sometimes found at budget pricing.\\n\\nThe RTX 4050 was the budget baseline for some time, but the mobile RTX 5060 and RTX 5050 are now on the market. You\\'ll be able to play smoothly at 1080p with an RTX 4050, just not at high settings in newer games; the RTX 5050 raises the bar, and makes even demanding titles playable with DLSS 4\\\\. All should be able to provide at least a decent level of VR play if that\\'s your thing. An RTX 4060 is much more capable than an RTX 4050, so especially as the 50 series successors take over, look out for sales on older systems.\\n\\nProcessors are the next most significant difference. In a budget model, you\\'ll likely get a capable Core 5 instead of a faster Core 7\\\\. Still, some of the benefits of a Core 7 machine aren\\'t a major factor for gaming, but instead benefit [video editing](https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-video-editing-software) and other creative uses. So a Core 5 will usually do the job for basic budget gaming. Over the past few years, we saw more AMD Ryzen CPUs in cheap, general-use laptops than in affordable gaming laptops, despite their adoption in some higher-end or ultraportable gaming systems. AMD GPUs are much less common in budget gaming laptops than Nvidia ones. You\\'ll probably be sussing out Intel CPUs and Nvidia GPUs in the budget zone. \\n\\nOutside of the graphics card and processor, the other components should be closer to more expensive machines than you\\'d expect. SSD boot drives are the norm even in the cheapest new gaming laptops, though they may be small in capacity. The display will almost certainly be 1080p; grainy 1,366-by-768-pixel panels are now reserved only for the very cheapest non-gaming systems, and sharp 1440p isn\\'t a budget resolution. The RAM will likely top off at 8GB in the cheapest gaming laptops, but you will find some (more ideal) 16GB laptops in this range.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## What Else Do You Need to Up Your Game?\\n\\nCutting-edge ports like [USB Type-C](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-usb-c-an-explainer) and [Thunderbolt 4](https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-thunderbolt-4-why-this-new-interface-will-matter-in-pcs-in-2021) are beneficial now and will only be more so down the road, but look for at least two ordinary-shaped (aka, \"Type-A\") USB 3.0 ports so you can plug in an external mouse and a hard drive for your saved media files. There\\'s also a load of extras like RGB key and chassis lighting, software performance modes, and Ethernet ports for wired downloads or online gaming.\\n\\nIf you want to attach a wired VR headset to your rig, look for the right loadout of ports to accommodate it. You\\'ll need a well-placed HDMI or DisplayPort video out (it depends on the headset, which one you\\'ll need) and enough USB ports for a possible hydra-head of cabling. Other video ports, like DisplayPort or mini-DisplayPort (sometimes implemented over a USB-C port), will be helpful if you want to play games on an external display, but they aren\\'t necessary if your laptop\\'s screen is large enough.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Which Brand Is Best to Buy a Gaming Laptop From?\\n\\nOur picks run the gamut of many different brands, though we do often see the same names rate highly in our lists. Some of these are gaming specialists, and others are not. At any given time, you should expect to see some systems from the biggest manufacturers, which always sell multiple models and configurations at various price points. These primarily include Acer, Asus, Dell, and Lenovo. The last, in particular, has been serving up impressive value in the gaming category recently.\\n\\nSome of the more specialist brands that consistently produce great gaming rigs are Alienware (a Dell subsidiary), Gigabyte, MSI, and Razer. Some of these, particularly Razer machines, come with hefty price premiums but emphasize superior build quality.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Ready to Buy the Right Gaming Laptop for You?\\n\\nFeeling more prepared now to buy than before? We hope so. Our detailed spec breakout of all the top-pick machines we have laid out should help you settle on the best gaming laptop that fits your budget and your gaming aspirations.

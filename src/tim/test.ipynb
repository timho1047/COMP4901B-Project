A.J. was married to Evelyn, and was a loan shark that went to prison for tax evasion. After being released from prison, he suddenly died from from falling off a barn loft. Years later, Alyssa and her childhood friend [Adam Newman](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/Adam%5FNewman \"Adam Newman\") came to suspect that AJ had killed Cliff over an unpaid loan. They also theorized that Adam's father [Victor Newman](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/Victor%5FNewman \"Victor Newman\") had caused A.J's death in retaliation.\n",

He also remembered seeing A.J.'s body on the ground. Alyssa did some digging and found out that Victor had paid off the coroner that examined A.J.'s body. It seemed like A.J.'s death hadn't been an accident at all, and that Victor was somehow responsible. However, Victor claimed to be innocent, whenever Nikki or Victoria asked.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth was that young, 11-year-old Adam had killed AJ, then blocked it from his memory. With Cliff dead, AJ had been hassling Hope over the money that Cliff owed him. A.J. had been pressuring Hope to give him the farm to pay off the debt. Adam was there and saw the angry altercation. He yelled at A.J. To leave his mother alone, A.J. asked Adam what he was going to do about it, and pushed him to the ground. A.J. then taunted about Adam about having a darkness and rage in him. Adam then got up and accidentally killed A.J. by shoving him back, causing him to hit his head.\n",

      "Cliff's death had been an accident as well, as AJ had only wanted to scare Cliff into paying up. However, the guy AJ had hired to drive the car was an alcoholic, and the crash ended up killing them both. This was never the intended outcome. It is unclear how Alyssa got this information.\n",

Initially, they thought it was just the storm, but after investigating, they discovered a young man named Jared. He had hurt his arm on some sharp metal while defending his grandfather's store against robbers. Elena and Nate wanted to look at his injury but Jared resisted their help at first. He was upset that his jacket had to be torn in order for them to treat the wound. Devon assured Jared that they would get him a new jacket. Once the doctors had finished with his arm, Jared was in a hurry to take off. His grandfather had diabetes and shouldn't be left alone. He promised to get a tetanus shot the next day but the trio had doubts that he would follow through. So, Devon followed Jared to his grandfather's store to get the address just in case. \n",

Amanda appeared and began asking questions about Jared's personal life. Did he go to school? Did he have a job? How old was he? Defensive, Jared claimed he was 18, and so there was no point to contact DCF. Amanda understood what he meant because she too had been in the foster system. DCF stood for Department of Children and Family. Jared used to be in the foster system before he had gone to live with his grandfather, but he was an adult now and could take care of himself. Amanda dropped the subject and gave him some money so that he could buy a dessert for the ride to the hospital. Jared thanked her with a smile. While visiting his grandfather at the hospital, he would also get a tetanus shot.\n",

      "Nate did everything that he could, but sadly, Jared's grandfather passed away. Nate and Devon immediately offered their support and started talking about the \"next steps\" for Jared. They were worried that he wouldn't be able to pay rent if he continued living above his grandfather's store. However, Jared insisted that he was perfectly capable of running the store himself. He rejected Nate's invitation to crash at his place and became overwhelmed with their attempts to help him. Pulling Nate and Devon aside, Amanda berated them for their lack of sensitivity. They needed to give Jared some space. Devon, of all people, should know better. When you grow up in the foster system, you put up walls and don't trust anyone. Devon agreed to ease up a little but refused to back off completely. They couldn't give up on Jared that easily, especially now, when he needed them the most.\n",

      "After his grandfather's death, Jared went off the grid for a few days, and no one knew where he went. Amanda became worried and considered asking Chance to track him down. Luckily, Nate was able to locate Jared. The young man had gotten into a fight with his landlord about the rent, and was now in jail. Nate, Amanda, Devon, and Elena bailed him out, and Jared took his imprisonment as a wake up call. Elena offered him a job filing papers at the new clinic, and this time, Jared was receptive to their help. Since Jared had dropped out of school when he was 16, he had to compete his GED. The studying might interfere with his work schedule, but Elena was very understanding and accommodating. It had taken Jared a while, but he finally realized that he was surrounded by kind-hearted people that he could count on. Although his grandfather was gone, he wasn't alone.\n",

The doctors soon discovered that he had overdosed, and became frantic that he would not survive. They tried to wake him up, but Jared was unresponsive. Finally, Jared stirred and regained consciousness. He confessed that he hadn't been the same after his grandfather's death, and he was too ashamed and embarrassed to let them see what had become of him. Elena and Nate had done so much to help him back in March, and Jared couldn't help but feel like he had let them down. Elena and Nate showed no judgement and were just relieved that he was okay. They promised Jared that they would help him, then sent him to the hospital in an ambulance. They decided that Jared should get a good night's sleep before checking in to rehab the next day.\n",

In fact, they even laid a trap for Kendra and Theo. They put one of Jack's old marketing pitches in Summer's work file on the Jabot servers, and loudly mentioned it in Kendra's presence. Kendra then texted Theo the password, who logged in to Summer's account. He blatantly stole the ideas, believing they were Kyle's. During the presentations, Theo was caught and fired.

Montalvo\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[ ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theyoungandtherestless/images/f/f9/AJ%5FMontalvo.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20200827192552) \\n\\n**Alexander Jameson \"A.J.\" Montalvo** was portrayed by Marcus DeAnda on March 20/23, and August 26-27 in 2020.\\n\\nAJ is the father of [Alyssa Montalvo](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/Alyssa%5FMontalvo \"Alyssa Montalvo\"). He was the son of Martin and Hazel Montalvo. A.J. was married to Evelyn, and was a loan shark that went to prison for tax evasion. After being released from prison, he suddenly died from from falling off a barn loft. Years later, Alyssa and her childhood friend [Adam Newman](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/Adam%5FNewman \"Adam Newman\") came to suspect that AJ had killed Cliff over an unpaid loan. They also theorized that Adam\\'s father [Victor Newman](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/Victor%5FNewman \"Victor Newman\") had caused A.J\\'s death in retaliation.\\n\\nVictor had newspapers clippings related to both the deaths of A.J., and Adam\\'s stepfather [Cliff Wilson](https://theyoungandtherestless.fandom.com/wiki/List%5Fof%5Fminor%5Fcharacters%5F%281990s%29 \"List of minor characters (1990s)\"). He also remembered seeing A.J.\\'s body on the ground. Alyssa did some digging and found out that Victor had paid off the coroner that examined A.J.\\'s body. It seemed like A.J.\\'s death hadn\\'t been an accident at all, and that Victor was somehow responsible. However, Victor claimed to be innocent, whenever Nikki or Victoria asked.\\n\\nThe truth was that young, 11-year-old Adam had killed AJ, then blocked it from his memory. With Cliff dead, AJ had been hassling Hope over the money that Cliff owed him. A.J. had been pressuring Hope to give him the farm to pay off the debt. Adam was there and saw the angry altercation. He yelled at A.J. To leave his mother alone, A.J. asked Adam what he was going to do about it, and pushed him to the ground. A.J. then taunted about Adam about having a darkness and rage in him. Adam then got up and accidentally killed A.J. by shoving him back, causing him to hit his head.\\n\\nCliff\\'s death had been an accident as well, as AJ had only wanted to scare Cliff into paying up. However, the guy AJ had hired to drive the car was an alcoholic, and the crash ended up killing them both. This was never the intended outcome. It is unclear how Alyssa got this information.\\n\\n### Crystal\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[ ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theyoungandtherestless/images/3/31/Crystal.png/revision/latest?cb=20251017050103) \\n\\n**Crystal** (aka The Girl in Green) is often seen roaming around the Grand Phoenix lobby. She is known for the frequency of her background appearances. Her first speaking role was in December 2020\\\\. Kyle and Summer were waiting for their deliveries, and Crystal told them they had arrived. It wasn\\'t until May 18th, 2021 that her name was revealed. Phyllis asked her if she\\'d seen Summer, but Crystal responded that she hadn\\'t. Later, Ashland tried to strongarm Crystal into revealing confidential info about the guestlist. Crystal refused and then Phyllis stepped in to warn him about the privacy laws. Later, her actress was finally discovered to be Krystal Mosley. \\n\\nOn September 1st, 2021, Billy tricked Crystal into giving him access to Victor\\'s hotel room so he could snoop for info on Neman Media\\'s plans.\\n\\nOn September 24th, Billy learned from Crystal that Jesse Gaines had checked out of the hotel. Billy asked if she knew anything about the sudden departure, but she had no idea why Jesse left so abruptly or where he had gone.\\n\\nOn December 29th, Phyllis told Lauren that Crystal would be taking care of all the New Year\\'s Eve festivities at the Grand Phoenix.\\n\\nPhyllis apparently thinks very highly of Crystal and would have her run the Grand Phoenix if she ever moved away. Phyllis told this to Amanda on January 24th, 2022.\\n\\nOn February 4th, Chelsea went to get a suite at the Grand Phoenix after selling the penthouse. Crystal greeted her cheerfully and handed her a room key.\\n\\nOn June 9th, Crystal apologized for Phyllis\\' absence from the Chancellor-Winters launch party.\\n\\n### Dan Szymborski\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[ ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theyoungandtherestless/images/5/52/Dan%5FSzymborski.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20201003122028) \\n\\n**Dan Szymborski** was portrayed by Robert Gossett on September 1st, 2020\\\\. He is a business associate of Newman Enterprises who is based in New York. Through video chat, Dan told Victoria he doubted her leadership and disapproved of the recent changes she had made to the company.

He was a potential candidate to be the content manager at Chancellor Media. Billy thought he was perfect for the job, but Lily hesitated. She thought that his name sounded familiar, and soon realized that he had once written a sleazy book, trashing a family\\'s reputation. The Beldners were formidable, somewhat shady industrialists back east, and Harris had been particularly harsh towards the grandfather in his slanderous writing. Lily called it \"a hatchet job\" and told him he wasn\\'t the right fit for the company. Once Harris had left, Lily accused Billy of having ulterior motives. She believed that Billy wanted Harris to write scathing stories about Victor. After all, Harris did have a talent for going after powerful men. Billy denied it, though came clean eventually. After coming to an understanding, Lily let it go.\\n\\n### Jared\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n**Jared** was portrayed by Michael Maclane in March 2020.\\n\\nNate, Elena, and Devon were checking out a building for their new clinic when they heard a noise outside. Initially, they thought it was just the storm, but after investigating, they discovered a young man named Jared. He had hurt his arm on some sharp metal while defending his grandfather\\'s store against robbers. Elena and Nate wanted to look at his injury but Jared resisted their help at first. He was upset that his jacket had to be torn in order for them to treat the wound. Devon assured Jared that they would get him a new jacket. Once the doctors had finished with his arm, Jared was in a hurry to take off. His grandfather had diabetes and shouldn\\'t be left alone. He promised to get a tetanus shot the next day but the trio had doubts that he would follow through. So, Devon followed Jared to his grandfather\\'s store to get the address just in case. \\n\\nLater, Jared came to the trio for help when his grandfather had a medical crisis. Nate went with the grandfather to the hospital while Elena and Devon got Jared something to eat. Amanda appeared and began asking questions about Jared\\'s personal life. Did he go to school? Did he have a job? How old was he? Defensive, Jared claimed he was 18, and so there was no point to contact DCF. Amanda understood what he meant because she too had been in the foster system. DCF stood for Department of Children and Family. Jared used to be in the foster system before he had gone to live with his grandfather, but he was an adult now and could take care of himself. Amanda dropped the subject and gave him some money so that he could buy a dessert for the ride to the hospital. Jared thanked her with a smile. While visiting his grandfather at the hospital, he would also get a tetanus shot.\\n\\nNate did everything that he could, but sadly, Jared\\'s grandfather passed away. Nate and Devon immediately offered their support and started talking about the \"next steps\" for Jared. They were worried that he wouldn\\'t be able to pay rent if he continued living above his grandfather\\'s store. However, Jared insisted that he was perfectly capable of running the store himself. He rejected Nate\\'s invitation to crash at his place and became overwhelmed with their attempts to help him. Pulling Nate and Devon aside, Amanda berated them for their lack of sensitivity. They needed to give Jared some space. Devon, of all people, should know better. When you grow up in the foster system, you put up walls and don\\'t trust anyone. Devon agreed to ease up a little but refused to back off completely. They couldn\\'t give up on Jared that easily, especially now, when he needed them the most.\\n\\nAfter his grandfather\\'s death, Jared went off the grid for a few days, and no one knew where he went. Amanda became worried and considered asking Chance to track him down. Luckily, Nate was able to locate Jared. The young man had gotten into a fight with his landlord about the rent, and was now in jail. Nate, Amanda, Devon, and Elena bailed him out, and Jared took his imprisonment as a wake up call. Elena offered him a job filing papers at the new clinic, and this time, Jared was receptive to their help. Since Jared had dropped out of school when he was 16, he had to compete his GED. The studying might interfere with his work schedule, but Elena was very understanding and accommodating. It had taken Jared a while, but he finally realized that he was surrounded by kind-hearted people that he could count on. Although his grandfather was gone, he wasn\\'t alone.\\n\\nJared unexpectedly reappeared on October 1st, 2020\\\\. To Elena and Nate\\'s horror, they found him collapsed on the floor of the New Hope clinic. The doctors soon discovered that he had overdosed, and became frantic that he would not survive. They tried to wake him up, but Jared was unresponsive. Finally, Jared stirred and regained consciousness. He confessed that he hadn\\'t been the same after his grandfather\\'s death, and he was too ashamed and embarrassed to let them see what had become of him. Elena and Nate had done so much to help him back in March, and Jared couldn\\'t help but feel like he had let them down. Elena and Nate showed no judgement and were just relieved that he was okay. They promised Jared that they would help him, then sent him to the hospital in an ambulance. They decided that Jared should get a good night\\'s sleep before checking in to rehab the next day.\\n\\n### Kendra\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n[ ](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/theyoungandtherestless/images/3/3e/Kendra%5FMarie%5FOldenburg.jpeg/revision/latest?cb=20200415233543) \\n\\n**Kendra** was portrayed by Marie Oldenbourg from March to April of 2020.\\n\\nKendra is a Jabot employee who likes to ski. One day at work, Kyle, Summer, and Theo were having a meeting. At some point, Kyle mentioned Kendra\\'s name and remarked that she was on thin ice. Summer wondered what he meant, so Kyle explained the situation. Apparently, Kendra had called in sick so that she could go skiing instead. She then posted about it on social media, which was how Kyle found out. After the meeting, Theo ran into Kendra in the hallway. He sympathized with Kendra\\'s frustration towards Kyle, then invited her to grab drinks together after work. With a smile, Kendra accepted his offer.\\n\\nOff-screen, Theo recruited Kendra to help him undermine his cousin. After digging up some dirt, Kendra arrived at Society and gave Theo a file that related to Kyle. Lola recognized Kendra as a Jabot employee, and assumed they were meeting for something work-related. Continuing their plan, Theo and Kendra met again at Crimson Lights. Somehow, Kendra had managed to get her hands on some of Kyle\\'s emails, but Theo told her that the messages weren\\'t scandalous enough to do any real damage. She promised to keep looking. Later, Kendra texted Theo and asked if he still wanted help with his Kyle problem. Theo said to hold off for now, but he eventually went back to scheming with Kendra against Kyle.\\n\\nWhen Kyle and Theo\\'s rivalry exploded, Jack knew he had to settle the dispute once and for all. He gave them a contest to see who could come up with the best marketing pitch. Feeling panicked, Theo used Kendra to spy for him. However, Kyle and Summer were suspicious of her hovering, and didn\\'t reveal any of their ideas in front of Kendra. In fact, they even laid a trap for Kendra and Theo. They put one of Jack\\'s old marketing pitches in Summer\\'s work file on the Jabot servers, and loudly mentioned it in Kendra\\'s presence. Kendra then texted Theo the password, who logged in to Summer\\'s account. He blatantly stole the ideas, believing they were Kyle\\'s. During the presentations, Theo was caught and fired. Presumably, Kendra was fired as well, since she was already on thin ice from the skiing incident.\\n\\n### Leann\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n**Leann** was portrayed by Christina Wildes in January 2020\\\\.

The girls got re-acquainted and started catching up. Lindsay explained that she had left her bartending job at The Matchbox, since Society pays way more. \\n\\nLater, Mariah opened up about Tessa leaving with Tanner and how much she missed her. Lindsay revealed that she had once been a roadie, and therefore knew what it was like to be on tour. The parties, the pranks, the one-night-stands. Seeing Mariah\\'s expression, Lindsay quickly backtracked and assured her that she had nothing to worry about.\\n\\nAs Mariah became more estranged from Tessa due to the distance apart, she started hanging out with Lindsay. One night, Lindsay went home with Mariah, who was upset. As Lindsay comforted Mariah, she kissed her. Mariah was stunned and kissed her back. They slept together and shortly after Tessa returned home to find Mariah in her bathrobe and Lindsay sitting on their couch. Since that night, Mariah and Lindsay haven\\'t been in contact.

In fall 2019, Devon discovered that not only does Amanda have a restraining order against him, but Ripley also has a restraining order against her. Amanda later told Billy that it was because he had become emotionally abusive.\\n\\nIn 2020, it was revealed that actor Christian Keyes would be portraying Ripley, starting in February. He made his first appearance when Amanda unexpectedly found him in her hotel room. Apparently, he hadn\\'t broken in. Ripley had made up some story about Amanda forgetting her scarf, and the cleaning staff let him in to get it. Still, Amanda was rattled, and refused to believe his claims that he was a changed man. He had stalked her back then, and he was still stalking her now! She was furious that he had violated the restraining order. Despite her anger, Amanda allowed Ripley to explain himself, and soon, they were reminiscing about the past. Amanda wasn\\'t interested in recapturing their romance, but Ripley said that their conversation had made him \"hopeful.\" At that moment, Billy happened to knock on Amanda\\'s door. Seizing the opportunity, Amanda let him in. Ripley wanted to talk some more, but Amanda told him to get out, and Billy backed her up.\\n\\nThe next day, Amanda was sitting in Crimson Lights, looking at the tracking software on her laptop. She was relieved to see that Ripley\\'s car was on the move in Madison. At least, that\\'s what she thought . . . until Ripley peered over her shoulder and sat down across from her. Like he said before, he had found the tracking device on his car. What he had failed to mention was that he had also removed it. Keeping her cool, Amanda secretly texted someone under the table, and as she and Ripley talked, Rey showed up to arrest him. Amanda enjoyed being in control for a change, since she could decide his fate now of whether or not he stayed in jail. She ended up dropping the charges, but made him vow to leave her alone and respect her privacy. Before being hauled to the bus station by Rey, Ripley ominously commented that Amanda isn\\'t as tough as she thinks she is.\\n\\nThe night of the 50th Newman Gala, Ripley mistakenly stabbed Victoria instead of Amanda. It was dark in the art exhibition room, and the two women had similar dresses and hairstyles. Amanda saw Ripley fleeing the scene and realized what he had done. For Amanda\\'s safety, a guard was posted outside of her hotel room. Abby also did what she could to make the hotel more secure. Despite the safety measures in place, Amanda was still very paranoid and shaken up. She later had a nightmare that Ripley had gotten past the guard and had broken into her hotel room. A few days later, someone eventually spotted Ripley on his way back into Genoa City. When he was apprehended by the police, weapons were found in his car. It seemed like he intended to try and hurt Amanda again. Amanda felt incredibly guilty for the whole fiasco and wished she had pressed charges against him for violating the restraining order. He\\'d been controlling and manipulative in their relationship, but she\\'d had no idea he could be capable of such violence. At last, Ripley would be put behind bars.\\n\\n### Shea\\n\\nHistory\\n\\n**Shea** was Traci\\'s masseuse.

There could be dire consequences if they let this get out of control. Lanie sided with Sharon that professional counselling was warranted, given the anxiety, bullying, and shifts in behaviour that Faith had gone through.

However, the Escape Club employees hadn\\'t reenacted it with her the way she\\'d wanted, and Becky was unsatisfied. Phyllis showed the script to Amanda and the two of them laughed as they read lines from it. In this version of the breakup, Becky got to dump Vince, instead of him dumping her.

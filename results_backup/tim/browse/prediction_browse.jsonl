It's triggered by chemicals released from damaged cells and pain receptors, typically lasting up to 30 minutes.\n\n2. **Formation of a Platelet Plug**: Platelets circulating in the blood become activated, clump together, and adhere to the damaged vessel lining. They release chemicals that attract more platelets and maintain vasoconstriction, forming a temporary seal at the injury site.\n\n3. **Coagulation (Blood Clotting)**: This involves a cascade of reactions through either the extrinsic pathway (triggered by tissue damage) or intrinsic pathway (triggered by factors within the bloodstream), both leading to the common pathway. This results in the conversion of fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin strands that form a stable clot, trapping platelets and blood cells to permanently seal the wound.\n\n<answer>The three phases are: vascular spasm, platelet plug formation, and coagulation.</answer>"}

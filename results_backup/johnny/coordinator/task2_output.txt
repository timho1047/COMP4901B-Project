I've already checked your calendar for tomorrow and added meal reservations. Let me provide you with the complete day plan:

**Date:** December 4, 2025
**Weather:** Cloudy during the day (35% rain chance), mostly cloudy at night (20% rain chance). High: 20.1°C, Low: 17.5°C. **Bring an umbrella just in case.**

**The Itinerary:**
- **[09:00] - [10:30]** **HKUST Lesson 1** @ Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Clear Water Bay
- **[11:00] - [11:45]** **Lunch near HKUST** @ Lunch near HKUST, Clear Water Bay
- **[12:00] - [13:30]** **HKUST Lesson 2** @ Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Clear Water Bay

- **[20:15] - [21:00]** **Dinner near Lei Cheng Uk Estate** @ Dinner near Lei Cheng Uk Estate, Sham Shui Po

**Meal Planning Summary:**
1. **Lunch:** I've scheduled lunch at 11:00 AM for 45 minutes, located near HKUST after your first lesson ends at 10:30 AM. This gives you enough time to eat before your second lesson at 12:00 PM.

2. **Dinner:** I've scheduled dinner at 8:15 PM for 45 minutes, located near Lei Cheng Uk Estate after your private tutorial ends at 8:00 PM.

**Note:** Both meal reservations have been successfully added to your calendar. The lunch reservation gives you a comfortable 15-minute buffer between finishing lunch and starting your second lesson, and dinner is scheduled right after your tutorial ends.

**Alerts:** No scheduling conflicts detected. Your day is well-structured with appropriate meal breaks.
